xtrans is a library of code that is shared among various X packages to
handle network protocol transport in a modular fashion, allowing a
single place to add new transport types.  It is used by the X server,
libX11, libICE, the X font server, and related components.

It is however, *NOT* a shared library, but code which each consumer
includes and builds it's own copy of with various #ifdef flags to make
each copy slightly different.  To support this in the modular build
system, this package simply installs the C source files into
$(prefix)/include/X11/Xtrans and installs a pkg-config file and an
autoconf m4 macro file with the flags needed to use it.

Documentation of the xtrans API can be found in the xorg-docs package,
in PostScript format in xorg-docs/hardcopy/xtrans/Xtrans.PS.gz and in
the original troff format in xorg-docs/specs/xtrans/Xtrans.mm .
