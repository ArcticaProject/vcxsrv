Here are the steps to follow to create a new pixman release:

1) Ensure that there are no uncommitted changes or unpushed commits,
   and that you are up to date with the latest commits in the central
   repository. Here are a couple of useful commands:

	git diff			(no output)
	
	git status			(should report "nothing to commit")

	git log master...origin		(no output; note: *3* dots)

2) Increment pixman_(major|minor|micro) in configure.ac according to
   the directions in that file.

3) Make sure that new version works, including

	- make distcheck passes

	- the X server still works with the new pixman version
	  installed

	- the cairo test suite hasn't gained any new failures compared
	  to last pixman version.

4) Use "git commit" to record the changes made in step 2 and 3.

5) Generate and publish the tar files by running 

	make PREV=<last version> GPGKEY=<your gpg key id> release-publish

   If your freedesktop user name is different from your local one,
   then also set the variable USER to your freedesktop user name.

6) Run 

	make release-publish-message

   to generate a draft release announcement. Edit it as appropriate and
   send it to 

	cairo-announce@cairographics.org

	pixman@lists.freedesktop.org

	xorg-announce@lists.freedesktop.org

7) Increment pixman_micro to the next larger (odd) number in
   configure.ac. Commit this change, and push all commits created
   during this process using

	git push
	git push --tags

   You must use "--tags" here; otherwise the new tag will not
   be pushed out.
