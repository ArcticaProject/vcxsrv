To build this tool you first need to install Visaul C++ Studio .NET 2003.

Open the mhmake.sln file in Visual Studio and compile for Debug and for
Release.
2 executables are generated by this process:
- Release\mhmake.exe : gnu make compatible make program with some specific
  extension is make the build process faster.

- Debug\mhmake_dbg.exe  : Has the same functionality but does extra 
  error checking on makefiles and has extra debugging options. This one
  is advised to be used when creating makefiles. When the makefiles are
  fully debugging mhmake.exe is a better choise because here the build
  process will be faster. mhmake.exe is more likely to crash when badly
  written makefiles are passed as input.
