this is a modified version of bison
the author of the changes is coetmeur@icdc.fr

all is quite like the standard bison install, except :


the bison++.man are man page that shows the differences between 
bison and bison++

the bison++.dman is a very readable file that generate the 
not as much readable troff/man file bison++.man

on DOS, use bison_pp.mak to build the DOS EXE with MSC7
there are no big trick in it. it can be directly loaded in
the PWB...
if you want to use another compiler, just compile
and link normally each source like on unix...
use large memory model, and look at the -D option I have added
in the MSC makefile... check also for compiler specific problems...

you can else get the DOS exe that come normally aside this archive...
