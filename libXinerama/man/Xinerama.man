.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fIevent_base_return\fP 1i
Specifies the return location for the assigned base event code
.IP \fIerror_base_return\fP 1i
Specifies the return location for the assigned base error code
.IP \fImajor_version_return\fP 1i
Returns the major version supported by the server
.IP \fIminor_version_return\fP 1i
Returns the minor version supported by the server
.IP \fInumber\fP 1i
Returns the number of entries in the returned XineramaScreenInfo array.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Xinerama
is a simple library designed to interface the Xinerama Extension for 
retrieving information about physical output devices which may be combined
into a single logical X screen.

.SH FUNCTIONS

.SS \fBXineramaQueryExtension()\fR

.LP
The XineramaQueryExtension function queries the Xserver to determine the 
availability of the Xinerama Extension. If the extension is available, the 
return value is True, and event_base_return and error_base_return are set to
the base event number and base error number for the extension, respectively.
Otherwise, the return value is False, and the values of event_base_return and
error_base_return are undefined.
.sp

.SS \fBXineramaQueryVersion()\fR

.LP
The XineramaQueryVersion function returns the version of the Xinerama extension
implemented by the Xserver. The version is returned in major_version_return
and minor_version_return. The major version will be incremented for protocol
incompatible changes, and the minor version will be incremented for small, 
upwardly compatible changes.
.LP
If the Xinerama library is compatible with the version returned by the
server, it returns nonzero. If the server does not support the
XINERAMA extension, or if there was an error during communications
with the server, or if the server and library protocol versions are
incompatible, it returns zero.
.sp

.SS \fBXineramaIsActive()\fR

.LP
The XineramaIsActive function returns a Boolean operator used to determine if 
Xinerama is activated on the screen. Returns True for active and False for 
not active.
.sp

.SS \fBXineramaQueryScreens()\fR

.LP
The \fBXineramaQueryScreens()\fR function returns info about each
individual output device within the Xinerama Screen.  The integer
pointed to by the \fInumber\fR argument is updated to the number of
output devices listed in the returned array of \fIXineramaScreenInfo\fR
structures.  \fBXineramaQueryScreens()\fR returns NULL and sets \fInumber\fR 
to 0 if Xinerama is not active.

The pointer returned should be released with XFree(__libmansuffix__) 
when no longer needed.
.sp

.SH NOTE
The original API provided for interacting with the XINERAMA extension used
function names beginning with \fIXPanoramiX\fR.   That API is now deprecated
and this API should be used instead in new software.
