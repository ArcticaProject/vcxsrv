How to enable the TrueType native hinter if you need it
-------------------------------------------------------

  The TrueType  bytecode interpreter is disabled in  all public releases
  of the FreeType packages for patents reasons; see

    http://www.freetype.org/patents.html

  for more details.

  However,  many Linux distributions  do enable  the interpreter  in the
  FreeType packages (DEB/RPM/etc.) they produce for their platforms.  If
  you are using TrueType fonts on your system, you most probably want to
  enable it manually by doing the following:

    - open the file `include/freetype/config/ftoption.h'

    - locate a line that says:

        /* #define TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER */

    - change it to:

        #define TT_CONFIG_OPTION_BYTECODE_INTERPRETER

  These steps must be done _before_ compiling the library.
