Prerequisites:
- Windows Vista or later (The built code can run on XP, but your build machine must be Vista or later. This is a limitation of Visual Studio 2013.)
- Visual C++ 2013 Express Edition (Update 3 is currently used)
  Visual C++ 2013 is probably also ok (not tested)
- Cygwin. I am not sure of the exact packages, but perl and git are 2 of them. Only 32-bit Cygwin has been tested.
- Python (3.2.x used: http://www.python.org/) + lxml python bindings (3.3.x used, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/lxml/)
- Set the Env Var PYTHON3 to the path to your python.exe . For example, C:\Python32\python.exe
- Gnuwin32 gperf, gawk, gzip, flex, bison (and it's dependancies), sed (and it's dependancies (http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/), gperf
- nasm (http://nasm.sourceforge.net). Make sure the nasm directory is in your path
- Make sure that the gnuwin32 binaries are in a directory path with no spaces, like 'C:\gnuwin32\bin'
- Make sure the environment PATH includes the directory where the gnuwin32 binaries are
- Make sure python is in the environment PATH
- To build the installer: NSIS Unicode
- To build the installer, make sure NSIS Unicode is in the path (e.g. C:\Program Files (x86)\NSIS\Unicode)
- If you are on 32-bit Windows instead of 64-bit like I am, edit setvcenv.sh for the 32-bit folder path differences

Open up cygwin's bash shell and cd to the top directory
Run the command `source setvcenv.sh`
Run the command (FIXME: `buildall.bat` or `buildall.sh`). This will build everything including the installer.
The 64-bit version will not be built and the 64-bit installer will fail. This is a limitation this XP compatible branch. Patches are welcome.

To clean the project tree (uses git) go to the top directory at a cygwin bash shell
and type in `git clean -dfx`
