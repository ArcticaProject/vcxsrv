.TH XdbeQueryExtension __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "X FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XdbeQueryExtension - returns the version of DBE supported by the server.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\&#include <X11/extensions/Xdbe.h>

Status XdbeQueryExtension(
    Display *dpy,
    int     *major_version_return,
    int     *minor_version_return)
.SH DESCRIPTION
Sets
.I major_version_return
and
.I minor_version_return
to the major and minor
DBE protocol version supported by the server.  If the DBE library is
compatible with the version returned by the server, this function returns
non-zero.  If
.I dpy
does not support the DBE extension, or if there was an error
during communication with the server, or if the server and library protocol
versions are incompatible, this function returns zero.  No other Xdbe functions
may be called before this function.  If a client violates this rule, the
effects of all subsequent Xdbe calls that it makes are undefined.
