.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server
.IP \fImajor_version_return\fP 1i
Returns the major version supported by the server
.IP \fIminor_version_return\fP 1i
Returns the minor version supported by the server
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.ZN XcupQueryVersion
sets
.I major_version_return
and
.I minor_version_return
to the major and minor TOG-CUP protocol version supported by the
server. If the TOG-CUP library is compatible with the version returned
by the server, it returns nonzero. If the server does not support the TOG-CUP
extension, or if there was an error during communications with the
server, or if the server and library protocol versions are
incompatible, it returns zero. No other Xcup functions may be called
before this function. If a client violates this rule, the effects of
all subsequent Xcup calls that it makes are undefined.
