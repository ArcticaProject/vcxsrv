/**
 * @file
 *
 * This file contains functionality for identifying clients by various
 * means. The primary purpose of identification is to simply aid in
 * finding out which clients are using X server and how they are using
 * it. For example, it's often necessary to monitor what requests
 * clients are executing (to spot bad behaviour) and how they are
 * allocating resources in X server (to spot excessive resource
 * usage).
 *
 * This framework automatically allocates information, that can be
 * used for client identification, when a client connects to the
 * server. The information is freed when the client disconnects. The
 * allocated information is just a collection of various IDs, such as
 * PID and process name for local clients, that are likely to be
 * useful in analyzing X server usage.
 *
 * Users of the framework can query ID information about clients at
 * any time. To avoid repeated polling of IDs the users can also
 * subscribe for notifications about the availability of ID
 * information. IDs have been allocated before ClientStateCallback is
 * called with ClientStateInitial state. Similarly the IDs will be
 * released after ClientStateCallback is called with ClientStateGone
 * state.
