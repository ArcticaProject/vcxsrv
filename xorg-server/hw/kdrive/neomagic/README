Neomagic KDrive driver for xserver

This is a very simple implementation for Neomagic based cards.
Almost all functions are handled by the VESA driver, and
only solid drawing and bitblt are done with acceleration,

This driver has been tested in MagicGraph 256AV+(NM2230) card
but it should work on other cards as well.

The only warning is to choose a working mode.  You can ask
for supported modes using -listmodes.  I use -mode 0x117.
