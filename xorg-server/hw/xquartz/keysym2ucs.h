/*
 * This module converts keysym values into the corresponding ISO 10646
 * (UCS, Unicode) values.
 *
 * The array keysymtab[] contains pairs of X11 keysym values for graphical
 * characters and the corresponding Unicode value. The function
 * keysym2ucs() maps a keysym onto a Unicode value using a binary search,
 * therefore keysymtab[] must remain SORTED by keysym value.
 *
 * The keysym -> UTF-8 conversion will hopefully one day be provided
 * by Xlib via XmbLookupString() and should ideally not have to be
 * done in X applications. But we are not there yet.
 *
 * We allow to represent any UCS character in the range U-00000000 to
 * U-00FFFFFF by a keysym value in the range 0x01000000 to 0x01ffffff.
 * This admittedly does not cover the entire 31-bit space of UCS, but
 * it does cover all of the characters up to U-10FFFF, which can be
 * represented by UTF-16, and more, and it is very unlikely that higher
 * UCS codes will ever be assigned by ISO. So to get Unicode character
 * U+ABCD you can directly use keysym 0x0100abcd.
