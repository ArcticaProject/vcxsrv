/** \file
 *
 * This file implements a mapping from remote XInput event types to Xdmx
 * XInput event types.
 *
 * The exglobals.h file defines global server-side variables with names
 * Device* to be integers that hold the value of the type of the
 * server-side XInput extension event.
 *
 * The client-side X11/extensions/XInput.h file defines macros with THE
 * EXACT SAME Device* names!
 *
 * Using those macros to extract remote server event type values from
 * the (opaque) XDevice structure is appropriate, but makes a direct
 * mapping to the Device* integers impossible.  So we use the normalized
 * XI_Device* names for these routines.
