.SH NAME
XWinrc\- XWin Server Resource Configuration File.


.SH DESCRIPTION
The X Server for the X Window System on the Cygwin/X environment
running on Microsoft Windows, \fIXWin\fP can be optionally configured
with the \fIXWinrc\fP file.  A system-wide configuration file should
be placed in \fI
__sysconfdir__/X11/system.XWinrc\fP, a per-user file
should be put at \fI$HOME/.XWinrc\fP.  The \fIsystem.XWinrc\fP file is
read only if no \fI$HOME/.XWinrc\fP exist.
.PP
With the \fI.XWinrc\fP configuration file it is possible to do the
following:
.PP
1- To include items into the menu associated with the \fIXWin\fP icon
which is in the \fIWindows\fP system tray.  This feature functions in
all XWin modes that have such tray icon.
.PP
2- To include items into the menu which is associated with the
\fIWindows\fP window that \fIXWin -multiwindow\fP produces for each
top-level X-window.  That can be done both for the generic case and
for particular programs.
.PP
3- To change the icon that is associated to the \fIWindows\fP window
that \fIXWin -multiwindow\fP produces for each top-level X-window.
Again, that can be done both for the generic case and for particular
programs.  The new icons associated should be \fIWindows\fP format
icons \fI.ico\fP.
.PP
4- To change the style that is associated to the \fIWindows\fP window
that \fI-multiwindow\fP produces for  each  top-level  X window.   Again,
that can be done both for the generic case and for particular programs.


.SH FILE FORMAT
.B Keywords
are case insensitive, but in this document they will be written
completely capitalized.
.PP
.B Comments
are legal pretty much anywhere you can have an end-of-line; they
begin with "#" or "//" and go to the end-of-line.
.PP
Quote marks in strings are optional unless the string has included spaces,
or could be parsed, ambiguously, as a misplaced keyword.
.PP
There are four kinds of instructions: miscellaneous, menu, icon and style.


.SH Miscellaneous instruction
.TP 8
.B DEBUG \fIString\fP
The \fIString\fP is printed to the XWin log file.

.B TRAYICON \fIicon-specifier\fB
The \fBTRAYICON\fP keyword changes the icon \fIXWin\fP displays in the

.B SILENTEXIT
The \fBSILENTEXIT\fP keyword, which takes no parameters, disables the
exit confirmation dialog if no clients are connected.

.TP 8
.B FORCEEXIT
The \fBFORCEEXIT\fP keyword, which takes no parameters, disables the
exit confirmation dialog always.  Unsaved client work may be lost but
this may be useful if you want no dialogs.

.SH Menu instructions
.TP 8
.B MENU \fIMenu_Name\fP {
.br
.B       \fIMenu_Item_Line\fP
