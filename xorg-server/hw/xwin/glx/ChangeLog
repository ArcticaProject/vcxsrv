	* indirect.c:
	Fix passing of non-RGB visuals. The old code did not initialize the
	structure properly which lead to a crash in 8bpp mode

	* indirect.c:
	* glwindows.h:
	If a context is already attached copy it instead of reattaching to keep
	displaylists and share displaylists
	Enable tracing of often called functions with GLWIN_ENABLE_TRACE        
	ForceCurrent is a no-op now

	* Imakefile: 
	Bugzilla #1866 (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1866)

	* glwrap.c:
	* glwindows.h:
	Bugzilla #1866 (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1866)
	attachment #1818 (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=1818):

	* glwrap.c:
	Functions like glGenTextures and glBindTexture are in OpenGL 1.1

	* Imakefile: Added $(MESASRCDIR)/src/mesa/glapi to INCLUDES.
	Removed $(SERVERSRC)/mi from INCLUDES.
	Rearranged INCLUDES for better readability.
	* glwindows.h: Removed mipointrst.h and miscstruct.h from #include 
	since they are not used anymore.

2004-05-27  Alexander Gottwald  <ago@freedesktop.org>

	* glwindows.h: write current function and line in debug output
	* indirect.c: moved actual setup and creation of windows GL context to 
	glWinCreateContextReal. 
	* indirect.c (glWinCreateContext): Deferred context creation to attach.   
	* indirect.c (glWinMakeCurrent): Check if context is NULL. Fixes segfault.
