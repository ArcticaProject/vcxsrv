/* winPushPixels -- squeegees the fill style of pGC through pBitMap
 * into pDrawable.  pBitMap is a stencil (dx by dy of it is used, it may
 * be bigger) which is placed on the drawable at xOrg, yOrg.  Where a 1 bit
 * is set in the bitmap, the fill style is put onto the drawable using
 * the GC's logical function. The drawable is not changed where the bitmap
 * has a zero bit or outside the area covered by the stencil.

WARNING:
    this code works if the 1-bit deep pixmap format returned by GetSpans
is the same as the format defined by the mfb code (i.e. 32-bit padding
per scanline, scanline unit = 32 bits; later, this might mean
bitsizeof(int) padding and sacnline unit == bitsizeof(int).)
