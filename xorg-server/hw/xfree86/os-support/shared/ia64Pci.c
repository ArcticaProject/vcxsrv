 * We use special in/out routines here since Altix platforms require the
 * use of the sysfs legacy_io interface.  The legacy_io file maps to the I/O
 * space of a given PCI domain; reads and writes are used to do port I/O.
 * The file descriptor for the file is stored in the upper bits of the
 * value passed in by the caller, and is created and populated by
 * xf86MapLegacyIO.
 *
 * If the legacy_io interface doesn't exist, we fall back to the glibc in/out
 * routines, which are prefixed by an underscore (e.g. _outb).
