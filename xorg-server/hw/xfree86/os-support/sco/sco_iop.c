/*
 * There is a right way and a wrong way of doing this. Unfortunately, we
 * are forced to do it the wrong way. The right way is to be told the range
 * or ranges of I/O ports the driver(s) need access to, in order to use the
 * CONS_IOPERM ioctl() to grant access only to those ports we care about.
 * This way we can guarantee some small level of stability because a driver
 * does not have access to all ports (which would mean it could play with
 * the PIT and thus affect scheduling times, or a whole slew of other
 * nasty things). However, because XFree86 currently only enables or disables
 * ALL port access, we need to run at IOPL 3, which basically means the
 * X Server runs at the same level as the kernel. You can image why this is
 * unsafe. Oh, and this is not a problem unique to OSR5, other OSes are
 * affected by this as well.
 *
 * So, for the time being, we change our IOPL until such time as the XFree86
 * architecture is changed to allow for tighter control of I/O ports. If and
 * when it is, then the CONS_ADDIOP/DELIOP ioctl() should be used to enable 
 * or disable access to the desired ports.
