This is a submodule to access linux framebuffer devices.
It is supported to work as helper module (like vgahw)
for the chipset drivers.  There are functions for
saving/restoring/setting video modes, set palette entries,
and a few more helper functions.  Some of them can be
hooked directly into ScrnInfoRec.

In ../drivers/fbdev is a "chipset" driver.  It is a simple,
non-accelerated and hardware-independent driver which works
on top of this fbdevhw submodule.
