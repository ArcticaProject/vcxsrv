.SH NAME
Xorg.wrap \- Xorg X server binary wrapper
.SH DESCRIPTION
The Xorg X server may need root rights to function properly. To start the
Xorg X server with these rights your system is using a suid root wrapper
installed as __suid_wrapper_dir__/Xorg.wrap which will execute the real
X server which is installed as __suid_wrapper_dir__/Xorg.
.PP
By default Xorg.wrap will autodetect if root rights are necessary, and
if not it will drop its elevated rights before starting the real X server.
By default Xorg.wrap will only allow executing the real X server from login
sessions on a physical console.

.SH CONFIG FILE
Xorg.wrap's default behavior can be overridden from the
\fI__sysconfdir__/X11/Xwrapper.config\fP config file. Lines starting with a
\fB#\fP in Xwrapper.config are considered comments and will be ignored. Any
other non empty lines must take the form of \fBkey\fP = \fIvalue\fP.
.TP 8
\fBallowed_users\fP = \fIrootonly\fP|\fIconsole\fP|\fIanybody\fP
Specify which users may start the X server through the wrapper. Use
\fIrootonly\fP to only allow root, use \fIconsole\fP to only allow users
logged into a physical console, and use \fIanybody\fP to allow anybody.
The default is \fIconsole\fP.
.TP 8
\fBneeds_root_rights\fP = \fIyes\fP|\fIno\fP|\fIauto\fP
Configure if the wrapper should drop its elevated (root) rights before starting
the X server. Use \fIyes\fP to force execution as root, \fIno\fP to force
execution with all suid rights dropped, and \fIauto\fP to letter the wrapper
auto-detect. The default is \fIauto\fP.
.PP
When auto-detecting the wrapper will drop rights if kms graphics are available
and not drop them if no kms graphics are detected. If a system has multiple
graphics cards and some are not kms capable auto-detection may fail,
in this case manual configuration should be used.
