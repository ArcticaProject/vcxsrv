<title>X11 Input Extension Porting Document</title>

<para>
This document is intended to aid the process of integrating the 
X11 Input Extension into an X server.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Most of the functionality provided by the input extension is 
device- and implementation-independent, and should require no changes.  
The functionality is implemented by
routines that typically reside in the server source tree directory 
extensions/server/xinput.
This extension includes functions to enable and disable input extension devices,
select input, grab and focus those device, query and change key 
and button mappings, and others.  The only input extension requirements 
for the device-dependent part of X are that the input devices be 
correctly initialized and input events from those devices be correctly
generated.  Device-dependent X is responsible for reading input data from 
the input device hardware and if necessary, reformatting it into X events.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
The process of initializing input extension devices is similar to that used 
for the core devices, and is described in the following sections.  When
multiple input devices are attached to X server, the choice of which devices
to initially use as the core X pointer and keyboard is left 
implementation-dependent.  It is also up to each implementation to decide
whether all input devices will be opened by the server during its 
initialization and kept open for the life of the server.  The alternative is
to open only the X keyboard and X pointer during server initialization, and
open other input devices only when requested by a client to do so.  Either
type of implementation is supported by the input extension.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Input extension events generated by the X server use the same 32-byte xEvent
wire event as do core input events.  However, additional information must be
sent for input extension devices, requiring that multiple xEvents be generated
each time data is received from an input extension device.  These xEvents are
combined into a single client XEvent by the input extension library.  A later
section of this document describes the format and generation of input extension
events.
</para>
<sect1 id="Initializing_Extension_Devices">
<title>Initializing Extension Devices</title>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Extension input devices are initialized in the same manner as the core 
X input devices.  Device-Independent X provides functions that can be 
called from DDX to initialize these devices.  Which functions are called
and when will vary by implementation, and will depend on whether the 
implementation opens all the input devices available to X when X is initialized,
or waits until a client requests that a device be opened.
In the simplest case, DDX will open all input devices as part of its
initialization, when the InitInput routine is called.

InitInput is the first DDX input entry point called during X server startup.
This routine is responsible for
device- and implementation- specific initialization, and for calling
AddInputDevice to create and initialize the DeviceIntRec structure for each
input device.  AddInputDevice is passed the address of a procedure to be called
by the DIX routine InitAndStartDevices when input devices are enabled.
This procedure is expected to perform X initialization for the input device.

After InitInput has returned,
InitAndStartDevices is the DIX routine that is called to enable input devices. 
It calls the device control routine that was passed to AddInputDevice,
with a mode value of DEVICE_INIT.  The action taken by the device control
routine depends on how the device is to be used.  If the device is to be
the X pointer, the device control routine should call
InitPointerDeviceStruct to initialize it.  If the device is to be the
X keyboard, the device control routine should call
InitKeyboardDeviceStruct.  Since input extension devices may support various
combinations of keys, buttons, valuators, and feedbacks,
each class of input that it supports must be initialized.
Entry points are defined by DIX to initialize each of the supported classes of
input, and are described in the following sections.

The device control routine is called with a mode value of DEVICE_ON
by the DIX routine EnableDevice, which is called from InitAndStartDevices.  
When called with this mode, it should call AddEnabledDevice to cause the 
server to begin checking for available input from this device.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
&gt;From InitAndStartDevices, EnableDevice is called for all devices that have
the "inited" and "startup" fields in the DeviceIntRec set to TRUE.  The
"inited" field is set by InitAndStartDevices to the value returned by
the deviceproc when called with a mode value of DEVICE_INIT.  The "startup"
field is set by AddInputDevice to value of the second parameter (autoStart).
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
When the server is first initialized, it should only be checking for input
from the core X keyboard and pointer.  One way to accomplish this is to
call AddInputDevice for the core X keyboard and pointer with an
autoStart value equal to TRUE, while calling AddInputDevice for 
input extension devices with an autoStart value equal to FALSE.  If this is 
done, EnableDevice will skip all input extension devices during server
initialization.  In this case,
the OpenInputDevice routine should set the "startup" field to TRUE
when called for input extension devices.  This will cause ProcXOpenInputDevice
to call EnableDevice for those devices when a client first does an
XOpenDevice request.

DIX routines are provided to initialize the X pointer and keyboard, as in
previous releases of X.  During X initialization, InitPointerDeviceStruct 
is called to initialize the X pointer, and InitKeyboardDeviceStruct is
called to initialize the X keyboard.  There is no
corresponding routine for extension input devices, since they do not all
support the same classes of input.  Instead, DDX is responsible for the 
initialization of the input classes supported by extension devices.  
A description of the routines provided by DIX to perform that initialization

<title>Device Proximity Events</title>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
Some input devices that report absolute positional information, such as 
graphics tablets and touchscreens, may report proximity events.  
<function>ProximityIn</function>
events are generated when a pointing device like a stylus, or in the case
of a touchscreen, the user's finger, comes into close proximity with the
surface of the input device.  <function>ProximityOut</function> events are generated when
the stylus or finger leaves the proximity of the input devices surface.
</para>
<para>
<!-- .LP -->
<function>Proximity</function> events contain almost the same information as button events.
The event type is <function>ProximityIn</function> or <function>ProximityOut</function>, and there is no
detail information.
