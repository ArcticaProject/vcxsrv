/* A monochrome frame buffer is a static gray colormap with two entries.
 * We have a "required list" of length 1.  Because we can only support 1
 * colormap, we never have to change it, but we may have to change the 
 * name we call it.  If someone installs a new colormap, we know it must
 * look just like the old one (because we've checked in dispatch that it was
 * a valid colormap identifier, and all the colormap IDs for this device
 * look the same).  Nevertheless, we still have to uninstall the old colormap
 * and install the new one.  Similarly, if someone uninstalls a colormap,
 * we have to install the default map, even though we know those two looked
 * alike.  
 * The required list concept is pretty much irrelevant when you can only
 * have one map installed at a time.
