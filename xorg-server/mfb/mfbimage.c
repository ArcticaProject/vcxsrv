/* Put and Get images on a monochrome frame buffer
 *
 *   we do this by creating a temporary pixmap and making its
 * pointer to bits point to the buffer read in from the client.
 * this works because of the padding rules specified at startup
 *
 * Note that CopyArea must know how to copy a bitmap into the server-format
 * temporary pixmap.
 *
 * For speed, mfbPutImage should allocate the temporary pixmap on the stack.
 *
 *     even though an XYBitmap and an XYPixmap have the same
 * format (for this device), PutImage has different semantics for the
 * two.  XYPixmap just does the copy; XYBitmap takes gc.fgPixel for
 * a 1 bit, gc.bgPixel for a 0 bit, which we notice is exactly
 * like CopyPlane.
