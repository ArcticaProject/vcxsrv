The XFree86/Xorg encoding files are in the public domain.

Most of these encoding files were generated by me in the winter of 1998/1998
from publicly available sources (notably from data files provided by the
Unicode Consortium) using a throw-away program written in Common Lisp.  Over
the years, a number of people have kindly added new encoding files to the
collection.

If you want to add a copyright statement to an encoding file, you need
your brain examined.
