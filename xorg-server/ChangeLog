    linux: Drain the console fd of data when using evdev for keyboards
    
    Works around a silly bug in the kernel that causes wakeup storms after
    too many keypresses.  Should fix the kernel bug too, but this at least
    keeps the idle wakeup count below 1000/sec.

    xfree86: If AEI is on, disable "kbd" and "mouse" devices.
    
    This consists of two parts:
    In the implicit server layout, ignore those drivers when looking for a core
    device.
    
    And after finishing the server layout, run through the list of devices and
    remove any that use mouse or kbd.
    
    AEI is mutually exclusive with the kbd and mouse drivers, so pick either - or.

    xfree86: if AllowEmptyInput is true, enable RAW mode on the console.
    
    Usually, the console is set to RAW in the kbd driver. If we hotplug all input
    devices (i.e. the evdev driver for keyboards) and the console is left as-is.
    As a result, the evdev driver must put an EVIOCGRAB on the device to avoid
    characters leaking onto the console. This again breaks many things, amongst
    them lirc, in-kernel mouse button emulation and HAL.
    
    This patch sets the console to RAW if AllowEmptyInput is on.
    
    Use-cases:
    1. AEI is off
      1.1. Only kbd driver is used - behaviour as-is.
      1.2. kbd and evdev driver is used: if evdev does not grab the device,
           duplicate events are generated.
    2. AEI is on
      2.1. Only evdev driver is used - behaviour as-is, but evdev does not need
           to grab the device anymore.
      2.2. evdev and kbd are used: duplicate key events are generated if evdev
           does not grab the device.
    
    1.2 is a marginal use-case that can be fixed by adding a "grab" option to the
    evdev driver (update of xorg.conf is needed).
    
    2.2 is an issue. If we have no ServerLayout section, AEI is on, but devices
    specified in the xorg.conf are still added [1], resulting in duplicate events.
    This is a common configuration and needs sorting out.

    config: don't add duplicate devices through HAL.
    
    If HAL is restarted, the device list is sent to the server again, leading
    first to duplicate devices (and thus duplicate events), and later to a
    FatalError "Too many input devices."
    
    dev->config_info contains the UDI for the device. If the UDI of a new devices
    is equal to one we already have in the device list, just ignore it.

    xkb: squash canonical types into explicit ones on core reconstruction.
    
    If we update key types from core, and groups 2 - n have a canonical type but
    the same symbols as the explicit type of group 1, assume that it was a core
    sym duplication according to Section 12.4 of the XKB Protocol Spec.
    Ignore the canonical types and pretend there's only one group for the key -
    with the explicit key type.
    
    The protocol spec does not cover this case, so we have to guess here.

    xkb: fix core keyboard map generation. #14373
    
    According to Section 12.4 of the XKB Protocol Spec, if a key only has a single
    group but the keyboard has multiple groups defined, the core description of
    the key is a duplication of the single group across all symbols. i.e.
    G1L1 G1L2 G1L1 G1L2 G1L3 G1L4 G1L3 G1L4
    
    The previous code generated G1L1 G1L2 G1L3 G1L4 G1L3 G1L4, leading to
    "invented" groups when the process is reversed.
    
    Note that this creates wrong key types on reconstruction from core to xkb,
    i.e. any single-group key with a key type that is not one of the canonical
    four (Sec 12.2.3), will get the assigned type on group 1, and a canonical type
    for the other gruops.

    Xevie: always initialize rep.length (bug#17394)
    
    The XEvIE extension doesn't clear the rep.length field for any reply but
    the version check. Hence, if there is junk data in it and that is sent
    to the client, it hangs.

    Don't abort if swrast library is not present

    register the GLX extension unless at least one screen has a usable

    Reimplement ShmPutImage.
    
    There's no reason to not just dispatch this straight into the GC.  As a
    bonus, if you do so, damage wraps correctly, and thus swcursor works.
    The side effect is it's no longer possible to override ShmPutImage with
    ShmRegisterFuncs().
    
    Also remove the (broken) damage tracking for same from EXA, since it didn't
    work right, and is now superfluous.

    xfree86: warn some more about potential missing input devices.
    
    Put out a warning if xorg.conf has InputDevice sections, but these aren't
    referenced in the used ServerLayout. This is only performed if AllowEmptyInput
    is enabled.
    The reason behind this is that the server used to auto-add the first
    mouse/keyboard sections if none where referenced. Now, with HAL and AEI
    enabled by default, setups that relied on this auto-adding break and are left
    without input devices. The least we can do is warn them.

    In DeleteInputDeviceRequest, leave the conf_idev (which is shared with
    xf86ConfigLayout.input) alone for devices that were specified in the
    ServerLayout section of the config file. This way, in the next server
    generation we are left with what was the original config and can thus re-init
    the devices.

    If devices are prepended to the list, their wake-up order on resume is not the

    inited last, are re-enabled before the xorg.conf devices and in some cases may
    steal the device files. Result: we have different devices before and after

    Work around the DIX losing mmWidth/mmHeight for RandR 1.1 DDXen.
    
    RandR 1.1 has a physical size for each mode.  It used to be that the DIX would
    remember these modes and pass them back up to the DDX when changing the screen
    configuration.  The DDX uses RR_GET_MODE_MM to query the driver for the physical
    dimensions of the screen, allowing it to preserve the DPI.
    
    With RandR 1.2, the physical dimensions are stored as part of the output, rather
    than per mode.  The DIX only uses the sizes passed in from the DDX to select the
    mode pool for the "default" output, and forgets the physical sizes.  Then, when
    reconfiguring the screen, it makes up a new RRScreenSizeRec using the dimensions
    from the output, screwing up the DPI.
    
    This change works around this problem by ignoring the DIX and querying the real
    size from the driver.

    Get out of the mesa symlinking business.
    
    This copies over the files generated from mesa/src/mesa/glapi.  There's
    a corresponding mesa commit that makes it easy to generate the glapi files
    straight into the xserver tree when the XML definitions change.
    
    The only few files that are copied from mesa but aren't generated are
    glapi.[ch] and glthread.[ch].  Everything in there is technically DRI
    driver API and the whole setup is still a bit fragile, but it's not a new
    problem.
    
    The --with-mesa-source configure option is still around since other
    parts of the server (XGL and DMX - grep for MESA_SOURCE) need that,
    but for common case of building with GLX and AIGLX support, that
    option is no longer needed.

    config: override xkb_{r,m,l,v} with Xkb{r,m,l,v} if the latter is set.
    
    The HAL spec says that input.xkb.{rmlv}* can be sent, but if the user
    specifies a X-specific {rmlv}, then this is overridden through the use of
    input.x11_options.Xkb{RMLV}.
    However, the way how the server parses options--by ignoring capitalisation,
    underscores and spaces--the HAL and the x11_options would override each other.
    
    So we simply filter the options, letting Xkb{RMLV} override xkb_{rmlv} and
    only actually add them to the device after parsing _all_ options.
    
    * rmlv ... rules, model, layout, variant

    CVE-2008-1377 - RECORD and Security extensions memory corruption
    
    Lack of validation of the parameters of the

    functions makes it possible for a specially crafted request to trigger
    the swapping of bytes outside the parameter of these requests, causing
    memory corruption.

    Xi: event_{x,y} should refer to the extended device (bug #16289)
    
    ProcessOtherEvents was unconditionally stomping the root_{x,y}
    co-ordinates provided by GetPointerEvents with those of the core
    pointer, meaning that both root_{x,y} and event_{x,y} reported to
    clients would reflect the sprite's position, not the position reported
    by the device that generated the DeviceMotionNotify or the
    DeviceButton{Press,Release} event in the first place.
    
    For key events we still take the sprite's co-ords, as we're delivering
    to the focus, which is the (VCP) sprite.
    
    Not cherry-picked from master as MPX fixes this anyway, by taking the
    co-ords of the sprite the device moves (be it visible or no).

    Prevent the -wm command line option from causing a SEGV
    
    The -wm (when mapped) option for the BackingStore support has been
    causing the server to dereference a NULL pointer.
    
    This has probably been the case since backing store has been
    implemented on top of Composite.
    
    It looks like (some of?) Composite didn’t expect its WIndowPtr
    argument to be the root window.
    
    In Composite’s compCheckRedirect() function we now avoid calling
    compAllocPixmap() and compFreePixmap() when the pWin pointer’s
    parent member is NULL, as is it the case with a server’s root window.
    
    This addresses:

    This happens to work ok on intel as there all fbconfigs with a
    depthbuffer > 0 also have stencil bits.
    
    This patch fixes this by first trying to get a fbconfig for default X visuals
    with both stencilbuf, depthbuf and doublebuffering, and if that fails fallback
    to trying to get one with only a depthbuf and doublebuffering.

    Bug #14692: Allow drivers to have a say in Xinerama visual consolidation.
    
    Create a new exported global variable, XineramaVisualsEqualPtr.  Use this
    pointer to decide whether two visuals are equal during visual consolidation.
    This pointer can be wrapped, which allows drivers and extensions to control
    which visuals are consolidated.  A wrapper can reject the visuals without
    calling down, but must call down and return that result if it deems the visuals
    equal.  This ensures that all layers agree that the visuals are equal.
    
    Pass the screen of the other visual into the VisualsEqual callchain.
    
    Don't free PanoramiXVisuals since we need it for PanoramiXTranslateVisualID.
    
    Don't skip the first visual on the other screen in PanoramiXMaybeAddVisual.
    
    Skip the loop in PanoramiXTranslateVisualID if screen is 0.

    Bug #13104: Don't let XAA glyph pixmaps anywhere near video memory.
    
    Since glyphs are stored in pixmaps now, they can make their way into VRAM,
    which invalidates a bunch of fast-path assumptions in the XAA code.  Thus
    you end up doing color-expands or WriteBitmap from la-la land and your
    aliased glyphs go all funny.
    
    Since XAA isn't ever growing the ability to do sane glyph accel, just force
    glyph pixmaps into host memory by catching them at CreatePixmap time.

    If a TreatAsTransparent window has any area in the borderClip, that will be

    Instead, simply empty the borderClip for TreatAsTransparent windows right up

    dix: Call DeleteInputDeviceRequest from CloseDownDevices (#14418)
    
    The DDX (xfree86 anyway) maintains its own device list in addition to the one
    in the DIX. CloseDevice will only remove it from the DIX, not the DDX. If the
    server then restarts (last client disconnects), the DDX devices are still
    there, will be re-initialised, then the hal devices come in and are added too.
    This repeats until we run out of device ids.
    
    This also requires us to strdup() the default pointer/keyboard in
    checkCoreInputDevices.

    EXA: Improve the algorithm used for tracking offscreen pixmap use.
    
    Replace the current score keeping algorithm with a rolling counter that's
    incremented in ExaOffscreenMarkUsed, with the previous value being stored
    in the area.  exaOffscreenAlloc uses the difference between the counter
    value and the value in the area when deciding which area to evict.
    It now also takes the size of the areas into account, and favors evicting
    smaller areas.
    
    The credit for these ideas goes to Michel Dänzer.

    Implement DRI2 direct rendering and update AIGLX to DRI interface changes.
    
    Get rid of glcontextmodes.[ch] from build, rename __GlcontextModes to
    __GLXcontext.  Drop all #includes of glcontextmodes.h and glcore.h.
    Drop the DRI context modes extension.
    
    Add protocol code to DRI2 module and load DRI2 extension by default.

    XKB: Fix processInputProc wrapping
    
    If input processing is frozen, only wrap realInputProc: don't smash
    processInputProc as well.  When input processing is thawed, pIP will be
    rewrapped correctly.
    
    This supersedes the previous workaround in 50e80c9.

    Bug #14332: Fix PCI access cycles from x86emu.
    
    The address written to 0xcf8 contains the PCI slot address to send the
    config cycle to.  However, we would ignore that and always send the
    cycle to the device whose BIOS we were running.  This breaks some
    integrated graphics platforms that have explicit knowledge about the
    system's host bridge, for example.

    OpenBSD support for libpciaccess.
    
    xserver and libpciaccess both need to open /dev/xf86, which can only
    be opened once.  I implemented pci_system_init_dev_mem() like Ian
    suggested.  This requires some minor changes to the BSD-specific
    os-support code.  Since pci_system_init_dev_mem() is a no-op on
    FreeBSD this should be no problem.

    Make xf86InitialConfiguration slightly smarter.
    
    Old heuristic was to find the first monitor that expressed a preference,
    then attempt to get all other monitors to agree.  This doesn't work
    particularly well when the two sets of modes don't precisely intersect,
    you get overlapping-but-not-identical output geometry and things go wrong.
    
    New heuristic is:
    - Exact user preference, if given
    - Exact output preference, if the same for all outputs
    - Best (largest) mode of modes common to all outputs:
      - with the same aspect ratio as all outputs (may be NULL)
      - with 4:3 aspect ratio
    - Then the old heuristic to try to get something lit
    
    Note that it is simply not doable to have a reliable initial output guess if
    you insist on trying to clone all outputs together.  It's far too easy to
    end up with displays that simply don't have modes in common.  We need to
    switch to right-of placement someday, once we're not limited to CRTC size
    limits and we have working multi-GPU in RANDR.

    XKB: Fix initial map setting on startup
    
    Due to an unwitting sense inversion when eliminating XkbFileInfo, we were
    setting the complete wrong keymap on startup (non-XKB map if we had an XKB
    map available, or the XKB map if we didn't have any available).  Invert the
    sense properly, and add two small bits that also went missing in that commit.

    Allow xf86DuplicateMode() to work correctly on read-only modes.
    
    Before this it was meaningless to try to mark DisplayModeRec tables
    const, since the mode name would be emitted as a pointer to an
    anonymous string constant, and therefore would have to be fixed up by
    ld.so and so couldn't live in .rodata.  With this change the standard
    mode lists can live in .rodata, and modes duplicated from them will
    have their names filled in on the fly.

    Fix Xinerama's consolidated visual handling.
    
    Formerly the code claimed it could only handle up to 256 visuals, which
    was true.  Also true, but not explicitly stated, was that it could only
    handle visuals with VID < 256.  If you have enough screens, and subsystems
    that add lots of visuals, you can easily run off the end.  (Made worse
    because we allocate visual IDs from the same pool as XIDs.)  If your app
    then chooses a visual > 256, then the Xinerama code would throw BadMatch
    on CreateColormap and your app wouldn't start.
    
    With this change, PanoramiXVisualTable is gone.  Other subsystems that
    were using it as a translation table between each screen's visuals now
    use a PanoramiXTranslateVisual() helper.

    XACE: Make the default window background state configurable per-window.
    
    To recap: the original XC-SECURITY extension disallowed background "None" if
    the window was untrusted.  XACE 1.0 preserved this check as a hook function.
    XACE pre-2.0 removed the hook and first abolished background "None entirely,
    then restored it as a global on/off switch in response to Bug #13683.
    Now it's back to being per-window, via a flag instead of a hook function.

    Revert "xfree86: plug a memory leak in xf86LoadModules."
    
    This reverts commit 3abce3ea2b1f43bd111664d4a57e5ccd282acab0 and
    6cbaf15e6109ba77819c4070f5b46c78237ec460.
    
    The memory returned to xf86LoadModule was allocated in doLoadModule, which
    calls the respective module's PreInit. As it turns out, input and output
    drivers store a pointer to the module elswhere, so freeing it in
    xf86LoadModule is a bad idea.
    
    For further reference: hw/xfree86/common/xf86Helper.c
        Input drivers: xf86InputDriverList[blah]->module = module;
        Output drivers: xf86DriverList[blah]->module = module;
    
    Unloading the module would not look pretty then.

    xfree86: plug a memory leak in xf86LoadModules.
    
    LoadModule() returns the only reference to a fresh piece of memory (a
    ModuleDescPtr). Sadly, xf86LoadModules dropped the return value on the floor
    leaking memory for each module it loaded.

    glx: Use glapi sources from the mesa tree
    
    With recent mesa HEAD, the glapi sources used only in the xserver glx
    module are carried in the mesa tree. Previously, these were generated
    separately and committed to the xserver tree.
    
    The build is changed to symlink these files like the other mesa sources.
    This reduces the chance for mismatches between mesa's glX API and the
    xserver's glX API.

    XKB: Ditch XkbFileInfo
    
    Sorry about the megacommit, but this touches on a lot of stuff.
    
    Get rid of XkbFileInfo, which was pretty seriously redundant, and move the
    only useful thing it had (defined) into XkbDescRec.  defined will be removed
    pretty soon anyway.  Is the compat map pointer non-NULL? Then you have a
    compat map, congratulations! Anyhow, I digress.
    
    All functions that took an XkbFileInfoPtr now take an XkbDescPtr, _except_
    XkmReadFile, which returns an XkbDescPtr *, because people want to deal in
    XkbDescPtrs, not XkbDescRecs.

    Resize composite overlay window when the root window changes.
    
    - This allows some compositing managers to work, even after randr12 has changed the root window size.
    - Thanks to ajax for figuring out the best place to put this.
    - Example:
    	- xf86RandR12SetMode() calls EnableDisableFBAccess().
    	- That calls xf86SetRootClip() which in turn calls ResizeChildrenWinSize().
    	- The final step is the call to PositionWindow().

    X86EMU: handle CPUID instruction
    
    After trying to switch from X to VT (or just quit) the video-amd driver
    attempts to issue INT 10/0 to go to mode 3 (VGA).  The emulator, running
    the BIOS code, would then spit out:
    
            c000:0282: A2 ILLEGAL EXTENDED X86 OPCODE!
    
    The opcode was 0F A2, or CPUID; it was not implemented in the emulator.
    This simple patch, against 1.3.0.0, handles the CPUID instruction in one of
    two ways:
     1) if ran on __i386__ or __x86_64__ then it calls the CPUID instruction
         directly.
     2) if ran elsewhere it returns a canned 486dx4 set of values for
         function 1.
    
    This fix allows the video-amd driver to switch back to console mode,
    with the GSW BIOS.
    
    Thanks to Symbio Technologies for funding my work, and ThinCan for
    providing hardware :)

    Don't break grab and focus state for a window when redirecting it.
    
    Composite uses an unmap/map cycle to trigger backing pixmap allocation
    and cliprect recomputation when a window is redirected or unredirected.
    To avoid protocol visible side effects, map and unmap events are
    disabled temporarily.  However, when a window is unmapped it is also
    removed from grabs and loses focus, but these state changes are not
    disabled.
    
    This change supresses the unmap side effects during the composite
    unmap/map cycle and fixes this bug:
    
      http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=488264
    
    where compiz would cause gnome-screensaver to lose its grab when
    compiz unredirects the fullscreen lock window.

    GL: Add GLX compile flags lost in modular X server changes
    
    RISC chips that trap on unaligned loads and stores need to
    define __GLX_ALIGN64.  This used to get added to the cflags
    in the old *.cf files but it no longer does in the modular
    X server.
    
    Also, Alpha needs to pass -mieee to the compiler as well.
    
    This is a simple backport of a patch that debian, and probably other
    distributions, have been applying forever.  To the best of my
    knowledge the patch was written by Jurij Smakov.  See Debian bug
    number #388125.
    
    I just checked and this has been rotting for more than a year in
    freedesktop bugzilla as #8392.

    include: never overwrite realInputProc with enqueueInputProc. Bug #13511
    
    In some cases (triggered by a key repeat during a sync grab) XKB unwrapping
    can overwrite the device's realInputProc with the enqueueInputProc. When the
    grab is released and the events are replayed, we end up in an infinite loop.
    Each event is replayed and in replaying pushed to the end of the queue again.
    
    This fix is a hack only. It ensures that the realInputProc is never
    overwritten with the enqueueInputProc.
    
    This fixes Bug #13511 (https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=13511)

    XACE: Restore the old background None behavior in response to bug #13683.
    
    From the X11 protocol spec:
    
    "If background None is specified, the window has no defined background."
    
    This means that toolkits and apps cannot rely on the "transparent" nature
    of the current implementation!  At some point before the next release,
    XACE will switch back to a solid background as the default.

    Most of those functions do not, in fact, work with circular mode lists,

    Patch to rootless code that should fix many crashes.  Credit to Ken Thomases
    at CodeWeavers for the patch.  From his description:
    
    Fix a display bug with the X server.  The Generic Rootless extension
    installs overrides for certain GC (graphics context) operations.  Within
    these overrides, they temporarily uninstall themselves, perform their work,
    and then reinstall themselves.  Except sometimes they would return early
    and wouldn't reinstall themselves when they should.  Now they do in all cases.
    
    Fix a bug in RootlessCopyWindow where early returns could leave the screen's
    dispatch table entry for CopyWindow unwrapped.  We think that this is
    another case (hopefully the last) of the rootless drawing bug.

    Initial support for Spaces -- if you use Expose to drag an X11
    window to another Space, it will work correctly (as opposed
    to just leaving a ghost window).  We accomplish this by listening
    for the notification from Xplugin that our window has been moved,
    and then we ask X11 to move the window to the new location.

    Xnest: fix lib dependancy to make libtool happy
    
            This fixes an undefined symbol error happening when compiling
            the server with the --disable-xv configure switch.
            Basically, xnest was linking against
            @XSERVER_LIBS@ and @XNEST_LIBS@ and the order of the libraries
            given to the linker at the end of the process was bogus.
    
            * configure.ac: make XNEST_LIBS contain the $XSERVER_LIBS re-ordered
              in such a way that the linker finds the symbols of all the libs contained
              in $XNEST_LIBS.
            * hw/xnest/Makefile.am: don't link against @XSERVER_LIBS@ anymore because
              XNEST_LIBS contains the right thing.

    XkbRemoveResourceClient wants to access xkbInfo if it exists, so make

    notifying clients while we're shutting the server down anyway.

    Modified performance patches from Arjan van de Ven <arjan@infradead.org>
    
    Subject: [PATCH] fix some performance gaps in Xace
    
    The XaceHook function is used in several hotpaths.
    The problem with it (performance wise) is twofold:
     * The XaceHook function has a big switch() statement for the hook number in it
     * The XaceHook function uses varargs to reassemble the final dispatch arguments again
    
    Both are expensive operations... for something that is known at compile time
    
    This patch turns the hotpath XaceHook call into a direct call to avoid
    the switch and varargs; this gives me over 10% performance gain
    on the x11perf benchmark.

    Move SIGUSR1 notification as late as possible.
    
    If we inherited a signal mask from the parent process that ignores SIGUSR1,
    then we will send SIGUSR1 to the parent to indicate when we're ready to
    accept connections.  Unfortunately, we send this notification way too
    early, right after creating the sockets rather than just before entering
    the main loop.
    
    Move it to just before Dispatch() so we're not lying quite so much.

    reduce wakeups from smart scheduler
    
    The smart scheduler itimer currently always fires after each request
    (which in turn causes the CPU to wake out of idle, burning precious
    power). Rather than doing this, just stop the timer before going into
    the select() portion of the WaitFor loop. It's a cheap system call, and
    it will only get called if there's no more commands batched up from the
    active fd.
    
    This change also allows some of the functions to be simplified;
    setitimer() will only fail if it's passed invalid data, and we don't do
    that... so make it void and remove all the conditional code that deals
    with failure.
    
    The change also allows us to remove a few variables that were used for
    housekeeping between the signal handler and the main loop.

    Note that the VCK is still not wrapped, so core events will bypass XKB.

    xace: Still more changes to selection code.  Removed the SelectionPtr from

    additional type codes so that it can be used for redirection.

    front of the list while marking it with the USERPREF bit which will cause it
    to be selected by the initial mode selection code.

    Introduce a new "GlxVisuals" option that controls which visuals are added.
    
    Right now we default to "all" which gives us a situation much like before,

    reduce the number of visuals the GLX module bloats the X server with.

    Separate handling of GLX visuals and GLX FBConfigs.
    
    XIDs for GLX visuals and FBConfigs used to be interchangable and the list of
    GLX visuals was identical to the list for FBConfigs.  This patch splits handling
    of these two data types and allows the X server to pick and choose the FBConfigs
    that are exposed as visuals.

    Bug #10304,12784,11603: Add quirks for several physical size issues.
    
    A lot of EDID writers apparently end up stuffing centimeters (like the
    maximum image size field) into the detailed timings, instead of millimeters.
    Some of them only get it wrong in one direction.  Also, add a quirk to let
    us mark the largest 75hz mode as preferred, which will often be used for
    EDID 1.0 CRTs.

    Allow the user to not have a screen section
    
    If none is present, a default one will be created. This will be attached
    to either the first device section in the xorg.conf (allowing you to
    specify something like using EXA without having a screen section) or a
    default screen section if none is present in the file.

    Don't require that the screen explicitly attach the device section
    
    This will allow the screen to not explicitly have a device section. If
    this is the case and there is a device section in the xorg.conf, the first
    one will be used. If there is no device section at all, a default one will
    be created that loads the automatically determined module.

    First pass at improved video driver autoloading
    
    This is what we're currently shipping in Debian. Enables the ability for
    drivers to ship a text file listing PCI ID's they support, and have the
    server read them on startup when no driver is specified. This works, but
    isn't the final solution.

    Xephyr: port XV/GL stuff of the new multiscreen architecture
    
            We can now launch GL or XV apps in any of the
            Xephyr screens we want.
    
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/hostx.c,h:
    	 (hostx_get_window):
    	 (hostx_create_window): make these functions be screen
    	 number aware.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/XF86dri.c : fix some compiler warnings.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrdri.c:
    	 (ephyrDRIQueryDirectRenderingCapable),
    	 (ephyrDRIOpenConnection),
    	 (ephyrDRIAuthConnection),

    	 (ephyrDRIGetDrawableInfo),
    	 (ephyrDRIGetDeviceInfo): in all those functions, don't forward
    	 the screen number we receive - from the client - to the host X.
    	 We (Xephyr) are always targetting the same X display screen, which is
    	 the one Xephyr got launched against. So we enforce that in the code.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrdriext.c:
    	 (EphyrMirrorHostVisuals): make this duplicate the visuals of the host X
    	  default screen into a given Xephyr screen. This way we have a chance
    	  to update the visuals of all Xephyr screen to make them mirror those
    	  of the host X.
    	 (many other places): specify screen number where required by the api
    	 change in hostx.h.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrglxext.c: specify screen number where required
    	 by the api change in hostx.h
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrhostglx.c: don't forward the screen number we
    	  receive - from the client - to the host X.
    	  We (Xephyr) are always targetting the same
    	  X display screen, which is
    	 the one Xephyr got launched against. So we enforce that in the code.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrhostvideo.c,h: take in account the screen number received
    	  from the client app. This is useful to know on which Xephyr screen we
    	  need to display video stuff.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrvideo.c: update this to reflect the API change
    	  in hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrhostvideo.h.
    	  (ephyrSetPortAttribute): when parameters are not valid
    	   - they exceed their validity range - send them to the host anyway
    	   and do not return an error to clients.
    	  Some host expose buggy validity range, so rejecting client for that
    	  is too harsh.

    Xephyr: better error handling in GLX forwarding
    
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrglxext.c:
    	  fixed various logging functions
    	  (ephyrGLXGetStringReal): make sure all the string is sent to clients
    	  including the ending zero.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrhostglx.c:
    	  (ephyrHostGLXGetStringFromServer): better error handling.

    Xephyr: Make glxinfo work on the ATI R200 free driver.
    
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyr.c:
    	  (EphyrDuplicateVisual): when duplicating the
    	  visual, copy the color component masks and the class
    	  from the hostX
    	  (EphyrMirrorHostVisuals): don't mix blue and green mask.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrdri.c: add more logs.
    	  (ephyrDRICreateDrawable): actually implement this.
    	  for the moment it creates a DRI drawable for the hostX window,
    	  no matter what drawable this call was issued for.
    	  (ephyrDRIGetDrawableInfo): actually implemented this.
    	  for the moment the drawable info queried for its attrs is the
    	  Xephyr main main window.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrdriext.c:
    	  (ProcXF86DRIGetDrawableInfo): properly hook this dispatch
    	  function to the ephyrDRIGetDrawableInfo() function.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrglxext.c: add a bunch of GLX implementation hooks
    	  here. Hijack some of the xserver GLX hooks with them. Still need to
    	  properly support byteswapped clients though.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrhostglx.c,h: actually implemented the protocol
    	  level forwarding functions used by the GLX entr points in
    	  ephyrglxext.c. Here as well, there are a bunch of them, but we are
    	  far from having implemented all the GLX calls.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/hostx.c,h:
    	  (hostx_get_window_attributes): added this new entry point
    	  (hostx_allocate_resource_id_peer): added this to keep track of
    	   resource IDs peers: one member of the peer is in Xephyr, the other
    	   is in host X.
    	  (hostx_get_resource_id_peer): ditto.

    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyr.c: make Xephyr mirror
    	  the visuals of the host X upon startup. This
    	  is important for GLX client apps.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/hostx.c,h: add a hostx_get_visuals_info()
    	  to get the visuals of the host X.

    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrglxext.c:
    	  (ephyrGLXGetFBConfigsSGIX): proxy the GLXGetFBConfigsSGIX call.
    	  It is a vendor extension to get the visual configs as a list of
    	  name/value pairs.
    	  (ephyrHijackGLXExtension): hijack the VendorPriv_dispatch_info
    	  dispatch table to register our implementation of GLXGetFBConfigsSGIX
    	  (ephyrGLXGetFBConfigsSGIXReal): added this where the real
    	   implementation of GLXGetFBConfigsSGIX is. It support bytes swapping.
    	  (ephyrGLXGetFBConfigsSGIX,ephyrGLXGetFBConfigsSGIXSwap): these are
    	  the dispatch entry points. They just call
    	  ephyrGLXGetFBConfigsSGIXReal.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrhostglx.c,h: reorganize the proxies to get
    	  visual params from the host so that they clearly support the different
    	  methods of doing so.

    EPHYR: Add an experiment proto proxy extension.
    
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/Makefile.am: add the proxy extension to
    	  ephyr. The proxy extension is an experimental extension that
    	  forwards protocol packets targeted at a given extension to the
    	  host X.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyr.c: init proxy ext.

    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrproxyext.c,h: ditto

    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/XF86dri.c: re format this correctly.
    	  Make function decls honour the Ansi-C standard.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyr.c: protect glx/dri related
    	  extension initialisation with the XEPHYR_DRI
    	  macro. Initialize the GLX ext hijacking
    	  at startup.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrdri.c: add more logging to ease debugging
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrdriext.c: ditto. reformat.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrglxext.c,h: add this extension to
    	  proxy GLX requests to the host X. started to proxy those nedded to
    	  make glxinfo work with fglrx. Not yet finished.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrhostglx.c,h: put here the actual
    	  Xlib code used to hit the host X server because Xlib stuff cannot be
    	  mixed with xserver internal code, otherwise compilation erros due to
    	  type clashes happen. So no Xlib type should be exported by the
    	  entrypoints defined here.

    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrhostvideo.c/h:
    	  (ephyrHostXVStopVideo): add this entry point.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrvideo.c:
    	  Basically add ReputImage and StopVideo implementations.
    	  Now, when other windows obscur the video window, the reclipping
    	  seems to be well handled using StopVideo and ReputImage.
    	  To do this, I was obliged to save the frame in PutImage, so
    	  that I could resend it un ReputImage.

    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/XF86dri.c: copy this from mesa source to enable
    	  Xephyr to talk DRI protocol the host X. In mesa, this is used by libGL.so to

    Initial dri forwarding big bricks.
    
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrdriext.c: added this to implement a DRI extension
    	  into Xephyr. Normally the DRI extension is only present in the
    	  xfree86 server, but I have ported it to Xephyr. The extension calls
    	  functions that declared/defined in ephyrdri.h ephyrdri.c that
    	  forwards the DRI calls to the host X. It does not work yet, as this
    	  entry is just to put the big bricks in place.
    	* hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrdri.c,h: declaration & definition of the
    	  DRI client API that would hit the hostX server.

    	  This changes the API of ephyrHostXVPutImage.

              (ephyrXVPrivSetAdaptorsHooks): don't hardwire advertising

              logs the error but does not exits.
              (ephyrHostXVInit): add this to be called at the beginning
              of xvideo lifetime. It sets an xerror handler that does not
              exit.
            * hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrvideo.c:
              (ephyrXVPrivIsAttrValueValid): this validates an attribute
              value.
              (ephyrSetPortAttribute): before setting an attribute,
              validate the new value so that we don't send a buggy

              (EphyrPutImage): first implementation.

            * hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrhostvideo.c,h:
             (EphyrHostXVQueryImageAttributes): add this call. It calls
             XvQueryBestSize xserver entry point. It uses the protocol
             level machinery because Xvlib does not expose that entry point
             as a C function.
             (EphyrHostXVQueryBestSize): added this wrapper around XvQueryBestSize().
             (EphyrHostGetAtom, EphyrHostGetAtomName): added this to get
              an atom or atom name from the host server
            * hw/kdrive/ephyr/ephyrvideo.c:
              (EphyrSetPortAttribute): convert the atom into an host server
              server atom before attacking the host server with it, because in
              in its current form, the input atom is only valid in xephyr.
              This fix makes this call work.
              (EphyrGetPortAttribute): ditto.
              (EphyrQueryBestSize): implement this.
              (EphyrQueryImageAttributes): implement this.

              (EphyrHostXVQueryEncodings): properly copy the fields because simple casting does
                truncate some fields.

    Xephyr: add "multiscreen" suport
    
    	* This patch adds multiscreen support to Xephyr. For instance,
    	  the command line : "Xephyr :4 -ac -screen 320x240 -screen 640x480"
    	  will launch with two "screens" - namely two main windows.
    	  The first main window represents a screen that has the number :4.0, with
    	  a geometry of 320x240 pixels, and the second one represents a screen
    	  that has the number :4.1 with a geometry of 640x480.
    	  The command line: "DISPLAY=:4.1 xclock" will launch the xclock program
    	  on the second screen, for intance.
    
    	*   this patch was edited by Dodji Seketeli <dodji@openedhand.com> for:
    	  - better style compliance with the rest of the Xephyr code
    	  - make sure Xephyr could be launched with no -screen option. By
    	    default that creates a default screen of 640x480 pixel like before
    	  - display full titles on the windows - with insctructions to grab
    	    keyboard and mouse - like before.

    Fix #12650: "windows not receiving mouse events in multiple screens context"
    
    	* dix/events.c, include/dix.h:
    	  (UpdateSpriteForScreen): added this to update the mouse sprite context
    	   when we switch from a pScreen to another.
    	* mi/mipointer.c:
    	  (miPointerWarpCursor): as we are switching to a new pScreen,
    	   don't forget to update the mouse sprite context.

    exa: add hooks for drivers to take over pixmap allocation
    
    This adds hooks for the driver to access Create/DestroyPixmap and ModifyPixmapHe
    ader.
    
    It allocates a 0 sized pixmap using fb and calls the driver routine to do
    work of allocating the actual memory.
    
    ModifyPixmapHeader is mainly required for hooking the screen pixmap which
    isn't create by normal methods

    Remove the PaintWindow optimization.
    
    This was an attempt to avoid scratch gc creation and validation for paintwin
    because that was expensive.  This is not the case in current servers, and the
    danger of failure to implement it correctly (as seen in all previous
    implementations) is high enough to justify removing it.  No performance
    difference detected with x11perf -create -move -resize -circulate on Xvfb.
    Leave the screen hooks for PaintWindow* in for now to avoid ABI change.

    Ignore - not just block - SIGALRM around Popen()/Pclose().
    
    Because our "popen" implementation uses stdio, and because nobody's stdio
    library is capable of surviving signals, we need to make absolutely sure
    that we hide the SIGALRM from the smart scheduler.  Otherwise, when you
    open a menu in openoffice, and it recompiles XKB to deal with the
    accelerators, and you popen xkbcomp because we suck, then the scheduler
    will tell you you're taking forever doing something stupid, and the
    wait() code will get confused, and input will hang and your CPU usage
    slams to 100%.  Down, not across.

    Deliver correct event when releasing keys on VT switch.
    
    In commit 41bb9fce47f6366cc3f7d45790f7883f74289b5a, the event delivery loop
    for Xinput enabled keyboards was changed and accidentally used the wrong
    index variable, causing random events to be delivered when returning from VT
    switch.
    
    In addition, in commit aeba855b07832354f59678e20cc29a085e42bd99,
    SIGIO was blocked during delivery of these events, but not for the entire
    period the xf86Events array was being used. Block SIGIO for the whole loop

    configure.ac: exclude pci-access dependency from XDarwin
    
    XDarwin doesn't need any of this pci stuff since it doesn't talk directly to hardware,
    so it doesn't make sense to require it when building on OSX/Darwin.

    Fix server version reporting to be the server package version.
    
    Previously, the server version reported by xdpyinfo and Xorg -version would
    bear some vague resemblance to a X.Org katamari version, but in the presence
    of modularization (and client-server relationships with different katamari
    versions on each side) those numbers don't really make sense.  Instead, just
    report the package version.
    
    When branching a stable branch, master's version should be immediately updated
    to the endpoint of the stable branch plus a snapshot of 1 (for example,
    1.4.0.1 after server-1.4-branch).  The stable branch should then be changed to
    RC0 at that time (1.3.99.0, for example).
    
    This scheme was partially attempted for server 1.3, but lacked the appropriate
    master updates, thus why it had to be revisited now.  While here, we can also
    remove a lot of versioning complexity since everything is based on the package
    version.

    Kdrive: unbreak kdrive linking
    
            * configure.ac: re-sort Kdrive libs so that symbols get properly resolved.
              Basically, all some libs are present in both $KDRIVE_LIBS and $XSERVER_LIBS,
              and some libs orders are not correct. So I made sure Kdrive servers don't have
              to link against $KDRIVE_LIBS  *and* $XSERVER_LIBS. They just have to link
              against $KDRIVE_LIBS now.

    [RANDR] Compare only milliseconds of config time. (Bug #6502)
    
    The timestamp transferred in the X protocol is a 32-bit number of
    milliseconds.
    
    The timestamp stored in the server is a structure that contains two fields:
    months (!) and milliseconds.
    
    When the server passes the config timestamp to the client, it discards the
    months part and sends only the milliseconds part.
    
    When the server receives the config timestamp from the client, it tries to
    guess the "months" part by looking at the current time and then maybe adding
    or
    subtracting one.  The guess is wrong after the server has been running long
    enough (several hours).
    
    I have added two ErrorF calls around the 'if' statement that returns
    RRSetConfigInvalidConfigTimestamp in randr/randr.c and my Xorg.0.log has
    this:
    
      randr request got good config time: 0:-2103495671
    
    for the first few successful xrandr calls, and
    
      randr request failed with RRSetConfigInvalidConfigTime: client passed
      1:-2103495671, server has 0:-2103495671
    
    when it fails.  The server has been running for 8 and a half hours.
    
    The obvious fix would be to ignore the months field and only compare the
    milliseconds.

    When bigreqs are not available, needed won't be larger than the maximum

    clarify the issues.

    xace: drop map-window checking hook, add new hooks for controlling the
    delivery of events to windows and clients.
    
    This is tentative.  It's likely that an additional last-resort hook will
    be necessary for code that calls TryClientEvents or WriteEventsToClient
    directly.  It's also possible that new xace machinery will be necessary
    to classify events and pull useful resource ID's out of them.
    
    The failure case also needs some thinking through.  Should event delivery
    "succeed" or should it report undeliverable?
    
    Finally, XKB appears to call WriteToClient to pass events.  Sigh.

    Xprint: fix handling of TrueType font name
    
    Debian bug #272368
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=272368
    In certain locales, some characters from some TrueType fonts were not
    appearing in the Xprint postscript output due to the font not being
    identified in the postscript output.

    Refactor PictureInitIndexedFormats.
    
    The plural version is now static, which is fine since it was only ever called
    from within picture post-init anyway.  The body of the work is now done with
    a one-shot (public) function that operates on a single format at a time.

    Implement core protocol backing store exclusively in terms of Composite.
    
    Composite's automatic redirection is a more general mechanism than the
    ad-hoc BS machinery, so it's much prettier to implement the one in terms
    of the other.  Composite now wraps ChangeWindowAttributes and activates
    automatic redirection for windows with backing store requested.  The old
    backing store infrastructure is completely gutted: ABI-visible structures
    retain the function pointers, but they never get called, and all the
    open-coded conditionals throughout the DIX layer to implement BS are gone.
    
    Note that this is still not a strictly complete implementation of backing
    store, since Composite will throw the bits away on unmap and therefore
    WhenMapped and Always hints are equivalent.

    EXA: Wrap Trapezoids to prevent excessive migration of the alpha pixmap.
    
    miTrapezoids creates an alpha pixmap and initializes the contents
    using PolyFillRect, which causes the pixmap to be moved in for
    acceleration. The subsequent call to RasterizeTrapezoid won't be
    accelerated by EXA, which causing the pixmap to be moved back out
    again.
    
    By wrapping Trapezoids and using ExaCheckPolyFillRect instead of
    PolyFillRect to initialize the pixmap, we avoid this roundtrip.

    LessThan/GreaterThan comparisons were used in the wakeup handler,
    and LessOrEqual/GreaterOrEqual in the block handler.
    
    Change it to use LessOrEqual/GreaterOrEqual in both functions,
    since this is what XSyncNegativeComparison and
    XSyncPositiveComparison imply.

    This reverts commit 2243b30e54df07892f75e3d65b687abe5b183cf3.  The existing
    DRI interface doesn't let us get from a __DRIdrawable to the corresponding
    X drawable, and thus, we can't implement AIGLX damage tracking with the
    current interface.

    blocks associated with the quirks, but is likely true.

    RRScanOldConfig cannot use RRFirstOutput before output is configured.
    
    RRFirstOutput returns the first active output, which won't be set until
    after RRScanOldConfig is finished running. Instead, just use the first
    output (which is the only output present with an old driver, after all).

    and the Xephyr virtual mouse keeps alive. With this patch the semantic changes
    turning '-pointer' && 'Xephyr virtual mouse' always false.
    
    Now we can open a device pointer and pass its options in Xephyr's command line
    without having other pointer unused.

    Create a Picture as well as a Pixmap at the time of AllocateGlyph
    
    This avoids some inefficiency in creating a temporary Picture
    for every glyph at rendering time. My measurements with an i965
    showed the previous patch causing a 10-15% slowdown for NoAccel
    and XAA cases, (while providing an 18% speedup for EXA).
    
    With this change, the NoAccel and XAA performance regression is
    eliminated, and the overall EXA speedup, (before any of the
    glyphs-as-pixmaps work), is now 32%.

    Use strong hash (SHA1) for glyphs
    
    Using a cryptographically strong hash means that comparing the
    hash alone is sufficient for determining glyph equality (no need
    to compare the glyph bits directly). This will allow us to replace
    system-memory copies of the glyph bits, (which we've only been
    holding onto for comparisons), with Pixmaps.

    ProcRenderAddGlyphs: Avoid allocating a glyph just to find it cached
    
    This is a cleanup without any real savings (yet). Previously, the
    implementation would allocate a new glyph, then (often) find it in
    the cache, and immediately discard the allocated object. This
    re-organization first uses a new FindGlyphByHash function and only
    allocates the glyph if nothing is found.
    
    This isn't a real savings yet, since FindGlyphByHash currently still
    does a temporary glyph allocation, but this is expected to be replaced
    immediately as we switch to an alternate hashing mechanism (SHA1).

    Build system: Non-dtrace distcheck hacks
    
    automake 1.10 really wants foo.c for foo.O, so give it some dummy files to
    deal with if it really needs them.

    Remove duplicated licenses
    
    Some files had two copies of the same license.

    Add proper COPYING file
    
    I went through the entire xorg-server distribution and aggregated all
    the licenses I could find (except the questionable GPL files, see my
    last mail).
    
    There are many many permutations on essentially the same license terms,
    but I have been pedantic and treated slight differences as separate
    licenses.
    
    Here is a description of the process I used:
    
    tar xvjf /usr/portage/distfiles/xorg-server-1.1.1.tar.bz2
    
    cd xorg-server-1.1.1
    find -name '*.c' -o -name '*.h' | xargs gvim
    
    egrep -Rli "permission|copyright" * | grep -v "\.[ch]" \
            | grep -v "\.in$" | xargs gvim
    
    cd ..
    tar xvjf /usr/portage/distfiles/xorg-server-1.3.0.0.tar.bz2
    diff -urNp xorg-server-1.1.1 xorg-server-1.3.0.0
    
    git clone git://anongit.freedesktop.org/git/xorg/xserver
    cd xserver
    git diff xorg-server-1.3.0.0..
    
    For each file, licenses have been aggregated as follows:
    
    If 2 files have identical license text but different copyright notices,
    the copyright notices are aggregated and the license text
    is included only once.
    
    Note that by identical I mean really identical, i.e.:
     'AUTHOR(S)' is not the same as 'AUTHORS'
     'KEITH PACKARD DISCLAIMS' is not the same as 'KEITH PACKARD AND COMPAQ
    DISCLAIM'
    
    Otherwise, licenses and accompanying copyright notices have been
    stacked.
    
    When going through the changes from 1.1.1 to 1.3.0.0 then HEAD, licenses
    have been added and removed (so I have reflected this since the original
    version of my COPYING file). It's slightly concerning to see that even
    between 1.3.0.0 and HEAD, new license permutations are being added. I'd
    suggest that a primary license be chosen and this would be indicated at
    the top of this COPYING file.

    Input: Fix stuck modifiers (bug #11683)
    
    Disclaimer: It's 6:51am.  I'm trying to be as understandable as possible.
    
    What was happening previously was this:
     * Press Alt
     * Extended event generated and processed: state is now Alt down once
     * Core event generated
       - keyboard switched: inherited state is Alt down once
       - event processed: Alt down twice
     * Release Alt
     * Extended event generated and processed: state is now null
     * Core event generated and processed: Alt down once
    
    If we switch the order:
     * Press Alt
     * Core event generated:
      - keyboard switched: inherited state is null
      - event processed: Alt down once
     * Extended event generated and processed: state is now Alt down once
     * Release Alt
     * Core event generated and processed: state is now null
     * Extended event generated and processed: state is now null
    
    When we carry over the previous state, it needs to be the _previous_ state
    (state and modifiersPerKey), assuming that we're going to catch now-core
    events for any of these.  For example, if Ctrl is held down as we pivot, we
    need to carry Ctrl over with a count of one, for which an extended + core
    release will then clear.  Carrying over the union of the previous state _and
    the state resulting from the immediate action_ was what broke things.

    If NoAutoAddDevices is given as a server flag, then no devices will be added
    from HAL events at all.  If NoAutoEnableDevices is given, then the devices will
    be added (and the DevicePresenceNotify sent), but not enabled, thus leaving
    policy up to the client.

    exaGetPixmapFirstPixel: avoid framebuffer readbacks if possible.
    
    If the pixel in framebuffer memory isn't modified since we uploaded it, we
    can just read from the system memory copy, wihch avoids both a readback and
    an accelerator stall.
    
    In principle this function is still wrong, and all the framebuffer pixel
    access should be going through (w)fb so we can get pixel layout corrections.

    Refactor how Composite adds visuals to the screen.
    
    Besides being slightly simpler to read, it's now trivial to add a depth-16

    such mistakes, I reviewed the server code and found four bugs of the same
    form.

    Screen size bounds check in ProcRRSetCrtcConfig not masking out reflections.
    
    When checking how to validate the selected mode and position against the
    current screen size, the test against 90/270 rotation did not mask out
    reflection, so that when reflection was specified, the 90/270 test would
    never succeed. This caused incorrect bounds checking and would return
    an error to the user instead of rotating the screen.

    Fix MEMORY SMASH in XkbCopyKeymap.
    
    XkbCopyKeymap reallocates the destination keymap when it is not large enough
    to hold the source data. When reallocating the map->types data, it needs to
    zero out the new entries. The computation for where to start bzero'ing was
    accounting for the size of the data type twice, once implicitly in the
    pointer arithmetic, and once explicitly with '* sizeof (XkbKeyTypeRec)'.
    This would often lead to random memory corruption when the destination
    keymap had existing map->types data.

    This patch changes the semantics of manual redirect windows so that they no
    longer affect the clip list of their parent. Doing this means the parent can
    draw to the area covered by the child without using IncludeInferiors. More
    importantly, this also means that the parent receives expose events when
    that region is damaged by other actions.

    Split up memory for devices configured in the config file.
    
    If we're using a continuous block here, we segfault when a device removal
    triggers an xfree call.

    exaGetImage: Don't migrate or try to accelerate for 1x1.
    
    This is mainly to avoid wasting effort for XSync(), but just reading a single
    pixel directly is probably faster than DownloadFromScreen anyway. Though in
    light of the latter, even larger thresholds might be useful.
    
    Also move the swappedOut check before the migration checks because migration
    can't actually occur when swapped out.

    This is to avoid issues with redirected windows which are located partly or

    drivers generally can't handle. The symptoms in such cases would be incorrect
    rendering or even crashes or hangs.

    Allow the location of the SERVERCONFIGdir variable to be defined at
    compile-time. This allows us to specify where the security policy will be
    located (Debian uses this to put it in /etc). The default is to the
    previous location.

    xf86XVFillKeyHelper assumed root clip never changed.
    
    When the root window changed size, xf86XVFillKeyHelper would not revalidate
    the GC, leaving the clip at the old size causing lossage (and possibly
    memory corruption if the screen and frame buffer shrank).
    
    Fixed by just using a scratch GC; saving memory, eliminating bugs and
    shrinking the code.

    AIGLX: Zero-copy texture-from-pixmap.
    
    When available, use the 2D driver texOffsetStart hook and the 3D driver
    setTexOffset hook to save the overhead of passing the pixmap data to
    glTex(Sub)Image.
    
    The basic idea is to update the driver specific 'offset' for bound pixmaps
    before dispatching a GLX render request and to flush immediately afterwards
    if there are any pixmaps bound. This should ensure that the 3D driver can
    use pixmaps for texturing directly regardless of the X server moving them
    around.

    DRI: Add TexOffset driver hooks.
    
    To be used by AIGLX for GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap without several data copies.
    
    The texOffsetStart hook must make sure that the given pixmap is accessible by
    the GPU for texturing and return an 'offset' that can be used by the 3D
    driver for that purpose.
    
    The texOffsetFinish hook is called when the pixmap is no longer being used for
    texturing.

    Disable all outputs and crtcs at startup.
    
    Leaving devices enabled during server startup can cause problems during the

    different purposes by the X server than by the BIOS. Disabling all of them
    before any mode setting is attempted provides a stable base upon which the
    remaining mode setting operations can be built.

    Disable Simba PCI bridge routing code (Bug #8020).
    
    The code in hw/xfree86/os-support/bus/sparcPci.c:simbaCheckBus()
    is trying to mimmick VGA routing by disabling I/O space responses
    behind the Simba PCI-PCI controller.
    
    Unfortunately, doing this also happens to disable access to the
    IDE controller I/O space registers, thus crashing the system.  The
    granularity of the I/O disabling in the Simba controller is not
    fine enough to disable VGA without also disabling the IDE controller
    registers.

    Provide UseDefaultFontPath option
    
    This provides a new option, UseDefaultFontPath. This option is enabled by
    default, and causes the X server to always append the default font path
    (defined at compile time) to the font path for the server. This will allow
    people to specify additional font paths if they want without breaking
    their font path, thus hopefully avoiding ye olde "fixed front" problem.
    
    Because this option is a ServerFlag option, the ServerFlags need to be
    processed before the files section of the config file, so swap the order
    that they are processed.

    Improve modules loading defaults
    
    Provide default modules that may be overrided easily. Previously the
    server would load a set of default modules, but only if none were
    specified in the xorg.conf, or if you didn't have a xorg.conf at all. This
    patch provides a default set and you can add only the "Load" instructions
    to xorg.conf that you want without losing the defaults. Similarly, if you
    don't want to load a module that's loaded by default, you can add "Disable
    modulename" to your xorg.conf (see man xorg.conf in this release for
    details). This allows for a minimal "Modules" section, where the user only
    need specify what they want to be different. See bug #10541 for more.
    
    The list of default modules is taken from the set loaded by default when
    there was a xorg.conf containing no "Modules" section.
    
    A potential problem for some users is that some users disable a module,
    most notably DRI, by commenting out the "Load" line in their xorg.conf.
    This needs to be changed to an uncommented "Disable" line, as DRI is
    loaded by default.

    Add fbCompositeRect() as another special case in the switch of doom in fbpict.c
    
    This is phase one of getting the two region walkers in fbcompose.c and
    fbpict.c merged together.

    In __glXCreateARGBConfig(), insert the new GL mode at the _end_ of the linked list.
    
    Previously, the new mode was added at the head of the list.  This caused the
    positional correspondence between modes and the XMesaVisuals array to be off
    by one.  The net result was GLX clients failing when they tried to use the
    last GLX mode/visual.
    
    We still have the problem of DRI drivers not being able to use the extra
    mode/visual introduced by __glXCreateARGBConfig().  glXCreateContext fails
    with BadAlloc if it's attempted.  This is also the source of the often-
    seen warning "libGL warning: 3D driver claims to not support visual xxx"
    Look into fixing that someday...

    Fix a buffer overrun on machines with excessively large PCI busses.
    
    Formerly we sized an array with a compile time constant, then initialized
    its size to the same constant, but the Linux PCI init code would increase
    that "constant".  So if you happened to have more than 128 PCI devices,
    you'd happily scribble into whatever variables happened to be in .bss
    after that array.
    
    Only really fixed for Linux atm.  Other OSes will simply (still) fail to
    work on video devices above the 128th PCI device.

    From pixman (Jeff Muizelaar)
    
        Fix up the fast-path compositing operators; those are useful for
        sources without alpha, but can't be used for sources with
        alpha. Also, replaced fbCompositeSrcSrc_nxn with call to fbBlt as
        this function must handle 1, 4, 8, 16, 24, 32 bpp objects. Would
        be nice to optimize fbBlt for common cases involving 8, 16, 24 and
        32bpp.

    Disable SourceValidate in rotation to capture cursor.
    
    SourceValidate is used exclusively by the software cursor code to pull the
    cursor off of the screen before using the screen as a source operand. This
    eliminates the software cursor from the frame buffer while painting the
    rotated image though. Disabling this function by temporarily setting the
    screen function pointer to NULL causes the cursor image to be captured.

    Was accidentally disabling rotation updates in mode set.
    
    Setting a mode on an unrotated CRTC was causing all of the rotation updates
    to be disabled; the loop looking for active rotation wasn't actually looking
    at each crtc, it was looking at the modified crtc many times.

    Changes for single-entity multi-screen DRI.
    
    The entity (device) has a locking SAREA and a master file descriptor
    that optionally isn't closed between server generation.
    
    The locking SAREA contains the device hardware lock.
    Each DRI screen creates an new SAREA containing the drawable lock,
    drawable-and private info, the drawable SAREA.
    
    The first screen optionally shares its drawable SAREA with the
    device SAREA.
    
    Default is to close the master descriptor between server generations,
    and to share the drawable SAREA of the first screen with the device locking
    SAREA. Thus we should (hopefully) have full backwards compatibility.
    
    Mesa changes to support single-device multiple screens are pending.

    Bug #10560: Code-Cleanup: function declarations () -> (void)
    
    X.Org Bugzilla #10560: <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10560>
    Patch #9511 <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=9511>

commit f24391dbfd12a84253dfec794ee7884afd52e197

Date:   Mon Apr 9 12:30:31 2007 -0700

    In AIGLX EnterVT processing, invoke driver EnterVT before resuming glx.
    
    As the driver EnterVT function generally re-enables the hardware and
    prepares it for rendering, it must be called before any gl functions are
    called which could touch the hardware.

    Add setrlimit call in -core option to make dumps occur.
    
    Default core size limit for most environments is 0, which disables core
    dumps. Add code in the -core option processing path to set the core limit to
    the maximum value.

    XFree86: Treat evdev and vmmouse as mouse drivers (bug #10512, #10559)
    
    When we see an evdev or vmmouse section, assume that it's a mouse, and
    don't add a default mouse device.  This will break users who have an
    evdev keyboard section but no mouse, and want the mouse to get added
    by default.

    Swap RRScreenChangeNotifyEvent dimensions when the screen has one crtc and it's rotated.
    
    RandR 1.1 clients expect the size fields in this event to be the unrotated
    dimensions of the screen.  This behavior is "weird", but that's the way the old
    code worked so we need to be bug-compatible with it.

    Split the xserver/fb/fbcmap.c file into two files.
    
    Now, fbcmap_mi.c contains the fb functions which just wrap mi functions.
    Previously, these were in fbcmap.c and compiled when XFree86Server was defined.
    Now, clients of fbcmap should either use fbcmap.c or fbcmap_mi.c and not worry
    about setting the XFree86Server symbol.

    In dmxBackendMouGetInfo() initialize the info->minval[], maxval[] arrays to the size of the backend display.
    
    It seems that the changes to X input exposed a problem that wasn't detected
    before.  The axis clipping code in GetPointerEvents() uses those limits to
    constrain the pointer's coordinate range.  The max was zero so the pointer
    couldn't move.

    Checkpoint DMX updates: things are working much better now, but still not 100% right.
    
    Use new dmxCoreMotion2() function which enqueues motion events with
    GetPointerEvents()/mieqEnqueue().
    The clipAxis() code in GetPointerEvents() is causing some grief.  The
    limits seem to have always been (0,0) according to the original calls
    to InitValuatorAxisStruct() in dmxinputinit.c.
    Terrible hack for now: Call InitValuatorAxisStruct() with hard-coded max
    values of 1280 (my screen width).

    Refuse to initialize Composite if Render is not present.
    
    Composite relies on the presence of Render, in particular for the automatic
    compositing.

    Move libcw setup to the only renderer requiring it (XAA).
    
    Additionally, protect libcw setup behind checks for Render, to avoid
    segfaulting if Render isn't available (xnest).
    
    The previous setup was an ABI-preserving dance, which is better nuked now.
    Now, anything that needs libcw must explicitly initialize it, and
    miDisableCompositeWrapper (previously only called by EXA and presumably binary
    drivers) is gone.

    Make pending properties force mode set. And, remove AttachScreen calls.
    
    Yes, two changes in one commit. Sorry 'bout that.
    
    The first change ensures that when pending property values have been
    changed, a mode set to the current mode will actually do something, rather
    than being identified as a no-op. In addition, the driver no longer needs to
    manage the migration of pending to current values, that is handled both
    within the xf86 mode setting code (to deal with non-RandR changes) as well
    as within the RandR extension itself.
    
    The second change eliminates the two-call Create/AttachScreen stuff that was
    done in a failed attempt to create RandR resources before the screen
    structures were allocated. Merging these back into the Create function is
    cleaner.

    The DDC code sets the I2C timeouts to VESA standards, except that it had an
    extra setting of the ByteTimeout value which was wrong (off by a factor of
    50). Removing this should help DDC work on many more monitors. Note that the
    Intel driver duplicated these settings, along with the error. Yay for cult
    and paste coding.

    Correct ref counting of RRMode structures
    
    RRModes are referenced by the resource db, RROutput and RRCrtc structures.
    Ensure that the mode reference count is decremented each time a reference is
    lost from one of these sources. The missing destroys were in
    RRCrtcDestroyResource and RROutputDestroyResource, which only happen at
    server reset time, so modes would be unavailable in subsequent server
    generations.

    Eliminate RRModeRec devPrivate field.
    
    The xf86 mode setting code was mis-using this field to try and store a
    pointer to a DisplayModeRec, however, each output has its own copy of every
    DisplayModeRec leaving the one in in the RRModeRec devPrivate field pointing
    at a random DisplayModeRec.
    
    Instead of attempting to rectify this, eliminating the devPrivate entirely
    turned out to be very easy; the DDX code now accepts an arbitrary RRModeRec
    structure and set that to the hardware, converting it on the fly to a
    DisplayModeRec as needed.

    Add support for user-defined modelines in RandR.
    
    The RandR protocol spec has several requests in support of user-defined
    modes, but the implementation was stubbed out inside the X server. Fill out
    the DIX portion and start on the xf86 DDX portion. It might be necessary to

    Don't wedge when rotating more than one CRTC.
    
    Rotation block handler was re-registering the rotation damage structure,
    creating an infinite loop in the damage code. Track registration of the

    Create driver-independent CRTC-based cursor layer.
    
    This moves most of the cursor management code out of the intel driver and
    into the general server code. Of course, the hope is that this code will be
    useful for other driver writers as well.
    
    Check out xf86Crtc.h for the usage information, making sure you add the
    needed hooks to the crtc funcs structure for your driver.

    When rotating from left to right, the pixmap doesn't get reallocated, and so

    Add a canGrow argument to xf86InitialConfiguration.
    
    canGrow indicates to the DDX that the driver can enlarge the desktop via the
    xf86_config->funcs->resize hook.  If so, xf86InitialConfiguration will set
    virtual[XY] to match the configuration it chooses and will leave the crtc config
    size ranges alone.  If FALSE, it will bloat the screen to fit the largest probed
    mode and also set the crtc config max size to limit the desktop to the initial
    virtual[XY] size.

    This hook is called when the DDX needs to resize the screen.  The driver is

    screen properties (devPrivate.ptr, devKind, displayWidth, etc.).
    
    Use the size range from the crtc config instead of randrp->virtual[XY] when
    reporting the min and max screen sizes to the DDX.

    DRI: Make sure number of DRI windows is accurate in driver ClipNotify hook.
    
    Always call DRI{De,In}creaseNumberVisible (which in turn calls
    DRIDriverClipNotify) after updating pDRIPriv->nrWindows.

    DRI: New ClipNotify driver hook.
    
    The hook is called whenever the clipList of any DRI window changes, be it via
    DRIClipNotify, DRICreateDrawable or DRIDrawablePrivDelete. This allows the
    driver to keep track of which DRI windows are visible where.

    Check for clientGone before sending events from XFixes (bug #1753).
    
    Freeing resources during client closedown can cause cursor changes which
    attempt to send cursor events through the XFixes extension; a client in the
    process of closing down has no file to send events to, causing a crash when
    this path is hit.

    randr initialization anyways.

    Enable startup-time rotation; change rotation pixmap creation API.
    
    Add monitor "Rotate" option taking one of "normal", "left", "inverted" or
    "right". However, because initial mode selection is made before the screen
    is completely initialized, we cannot create the shadow pixmap object at this
    point. Pend the shadow pixmap creation until the block handler.
    
    Note that this code is not completely functional yet.

    Kludge around duplicate code added in hw/xfree86/modes.
    
    Code added in hw/xfree86/modes came from the server-1.3-branch.
    Portions of this code had previously been integrated into xf86Mode.c
    and edid_modes.c.
    
    To preserve hw/xfree86/modes as much as possible, the duplicate code from
    the other files has been disabled; a more careful review would figure out
    where that code actually belonged.

    Report correct RandR 1.0 sizeID. Report correct subpixel order.
    
    RandR 1.0 sizeID must be computed the same way every time, so when reporting
    it in the ScreenChangeNotify event, just construct the usual 1.0 data block
    and use that.
    
    subpixel geometry information can be computed by looking at the connected
    outputs and finding any with subpixel geometry and using one of those for
    the global screen subpixel geometry. This might be improved by reporting
    None if more than one screen has information and they conflict.

    This instruction is being used in some debug VBIOSes.  This implementation
    doesn't even try to be accurate.  Instead, it just increments the counter by a
    fixed amount every time an rdtsc instruction in encountered, to avoid divides by
    zero.

    Bug #9680: Remove bogus blank length limiting in xf86SetModeCrtc().
    
    Our modes typically come from EDID or default modes, and when the monitor
    asks for a specific mode, deciding to tweak it usually results in incorrect
    display.  And if the user is specifying a mode by hand, tweaking it then is
    still pretty rude.

    Replace PciBusId with 'struct pci_device *'
    
    There's no need to store the slot information for a PCI device as its
    ID.  Instead, skip the middle man and just store a pointer to the
    pci_device structure.

    Rather than allocate a 9 byte buffer on each invocation, use a static

    be cherry-picked to the trunk.

    Require glproto >= 1.4.8 for GLX.
    
    It builds against 1.4.7 as well, but it hardcodes the GLX_EXT_tfp tokens that
    were finalized in 1.4.8, so GLX_EXT_tfp breaks if the client side was built
    against an older glproto. This will hopefully alert people to rebuild other
    components (in particular Mesa) against the new glproto as well.

    Use RRScreenSetSizeRange in 1.0 compat. Check RRGetInfo for error.
    
    The RRScreenSizeSetRange function is used externally for 1.2 API drivers,
    but can also be used in the 1.0 compatibility code. This also ensures that
    the right changed bits are set so that clients are correctly notified when
    the range changes.
    
    RRGetInfo can return an error, use that to return BadAlloc to clients
    instead of blindly going on with various requests.

    fbdevhw: Consolidate modeset ioctl calling, report failure if it modifies mode.
    
    The fbdev API allows the driver to 'accept' modes it doesn't really support by
    modifying it to the nearest supported mode. Without this check, e.g. vesafb
    would appear to accept all modes, even though it actually can't set any modes
    other than the bootup mode at all.

    Switch the default migration heuristic for EXA to "always".
    
    This has been what has been used the most successfully post-damagetrack.
    The current thinking is that:
    1) We should be able to accelerate basically everything.  So we don't need to
       try to migrate trees of pixmaps permanently out of framebuffer to speed
       CPU drawing up.
    2) Migration is cheaper in the thrashing case, so we don't want to go to a lot
       of effort to try (and fail badly) to find a working set.

    RandR 1.2 rotation code must adjust width/height.

    RandR 1.0 refresh rates were scrambled when working with a 1.2 driver that
    returned sizes in a mixed order. SetScreenConfig was treating RRCrtcSet as
    returning an RandR status instead of a Bool.

    RandR: config time updates when hardware config changes.

    RandR mode list needs both output and crtc modes.

    included.

    Always chase a DeviceMotionNotify event with a DeviceValuator, which is
    not required in the spec, but will silently break the lib if you don't
    include.

    Add RRInit function to create resource types for RR objects.
    
    To allow RandR objects to be created before the screen object exists,
    the resource types must be registered with the resource database.
    A driver wishing to create RandR objects must call RRInit before doing so.
    
    Also, fix a segfault when setting Output data before it is associated with a
    screen.

    Allow RandR objects to be created before the associated ScreenRec.
    
    xf86 drivers need to create RandR object in the PreInit stage,
    before the ScreenRec is allocated. Changing the RandR DIX code
    to permit this required the addition of functions that later associate the
    objects with the related screen.
    
    An additional change is that modes are now global, and no longer associated
    with a specific screen. This change actually makes mode management cleaner
    as there is no more per-screen list of modes to deal with.
    
    This changes the RandR 1.2 ABI/API for drivers.

    Avoid dereferencing sprite.screen when Xinerama is not running. (#8925)
    
    With Xinerama support built into the X server but not in use,
    sprite.screen is NULL and yet the SyntheticMotion
    macro would dereference it. Avoid that by just passing sprite.screen
    to PostSyntheticMotion which can then dereference it when Xinerama is
    enabled.
    
    Also, define PostSyntheticMotion in dixevents.h and include dixevents.h in
    getevents.c

    Do not map full 0-1MB legacy range
    
    If we're mapping something in the "legacy range" (0-1Mb), we shouldn't
    expand the requested range to the entire 0-1Mb range.  Typically this
    is for mapping the VGA frame buffer, and some platforms support mmap of
    the frame buffer but not the entire 0-1Mb range.
    
    For example, HP sx1000 and sx2000 ia64 platforms can have memory from
    0-0x9ffff, VGA frame buffer from 0xa0000-0xbffff, and memory from
    0xc0000-0xfffff.  On these platforms, we can't map the entire 0-1Mb
    range with the same attribute because the memory only supports WB,
    while the frame buffer supports only UC.  But an mmap of just the
    frame buffer should work fine.

    Fixing mach64 driver bailing out on ia64
    
    Mach64 driver bails out on ia64 because it cannot map device
    memory. It turns out that some bogus and unneeded code attempts
    to find the root bridge of the device and fails to do so proberly
    as there this host-to-pci bridge is not existant. This code has
    been around for years although it completely unclear what it had
    been intended for. Fixing this by eliminating the bogus code.

    xkb: fix virtual modmap size computation
    Compute virtual modmap size bounded by nVModMapKeys-1, rather than
    nVModMapKeys.
    
    This is sort of a best guess.  The other way seems a little more
    logical, but also leads to segfaults pretty quickly if you hammer
    GetMap hard enough.  So let's try this one.

    xkb: make sure we set the map on the right device, not necessarily core
    Forgot that all XKB requests took a device spec: the comparison of
    'if working on the core keyboard, does this device send core events; or,
    is this device the core keyboard?' was broken.  Instead, what we want is
    'if working on the core keyboard, does this device send core events; or,
    is this device the one we're working on?'.

    config: unref connection, don't close it
    Just unref the connection instead of explicitly closing it (thanks, Rob
    McQueen).
    Add a commented-out unregister_object_path call: unfortunately, when we
    call it, libdbus segfaults.  But if we don't unregister the path, we
    can't register it again.  So regenerations are broken either way, but a
    little less violently like this.

    dix/devices: add devices in proper forward order
    Add devices in forward order with the normal linked list convention.
    Previously, AddInputDevice would add all the devices in reverse order to
    off_devices, before they were added again in reverse order to devices with
    EnableDevice.
    This just makes both work in forward order, which provides the ordering as
    you'd expect when hotplugging devices (i.e. adds them to the head, not the
    tail).

    mipointer: take device arguments, split miPointerAbsoluteCursor

    Remove miPointerAbsoluteCursor call from mieq, as we now deal with it in

    Make miPointerSetPosition (successor of miPointerAbsoluteCursor) take
    pointers to x and y, so it can return the clipped values.
    Modify callers of miPointer*() functions to generally use the new
    functions.
    This should fix things with multi-head setups.

    Always believe the monitor when it reports a reduced-blanking mode.
    
    CVT reduced blanking modes are typically only seen on digital connections to
    LCDs, but there are some monitors that report them as supported over the
    VGA connector too, which is perfectly legitimate, electrically speaking.

    In xf86MatchPciInstances, fail gracefully when there's no PCI device at all.
    
    This allows the autoconfig logic to fall through sanely on non-PCI machines,
    which importantly includes Xen virtual machines.

    Prefer driver-provided modes when matching name strings to modelines.
    
    Well, kinda.  Strictly we prefer M_T_BUILTIN strongest since those are modes
    where the driver has said it absolutely can't do anything else (VBE).  Then
    we look for user-defined modes, ie, modelines from the config file.  Then
    we consider modes reported by the monitor via EDID.  Finally if nothing has
    matched yet we consider the default mode pool.
    
    Within each of the above-mentioned classes, modes with the M_T_PREFERRED bit
    take priority over other modes in the same class.
    
    This logic ensures that the timings sent to the monitor exactly match the
    timings it reported as supported, which occasionally don't match the numbers
    you might get for that mode from CVT or GTF.

    Mark EDID modes as driver modes.  Infer virtual size from driver modes.
    
    This allows the server to guess an appropriate initial virtual size and
    resolution.  The heuristic is to select the largest driver-reported mode
    that matches the monitor's physical aspect ratio.  We revalidate this
    estimate after mode validation, since we may have filtered away all
    modes that would fill that size.
    
    Also, the EDID preferred timing is now marked as M_T_PREFERRED as well.

    Attempt to add the 'mouse' driver in more situations.
    
    Always add a mouse driver instance configured to send core events, unless
    a core pointer already exists using either the mouse or void drivers.  This
    handles the laptop case where the config file only specifies, say,
    synaptics, which causes the touchpad to work but not the pointing stick.
    We don't double-instantiate the mouse driver to avoid the mouse moving twice
    as fast, and we skip this logic when the user asked for a void core pointer
    since that probably means they want to run with no pointer at all.

    Bump the default pixel depth to 24, and default bpp to 32.

commit 72af975f9c8de0ff6796f1ce4b76dcf841d21e99

    Fix up EDID blocks where the max pixclock exceeds the preferred mode clock.
    
    Base EDID only lets you specify the maximum dotclock in tens of MHz, which
    is too fuzzy for some monitors.  1600x1200@60 is just over 160MHz, but if
    the monitor really can't handle any mode at 170MHz, then 160 is more
    correct.  Fix up the EDID block before the driver can see it in this case,
    so we don't spuriously reject modes.

    Don't translate monitor gamma to X gamma.
    
    The X gamma is used to set the output ramp of the card.  Setting a 2.2 output
    gamma going into a 2.2 monitor gives an effective gamma of 4.84, which is
    very much not what you want.

    the new PCI mapping routines are broken on sparc64 (in fact they look
    broken for any 32 bit X server running on a 64 bit kernel) so #ifdef
    them out for now.  the PCI rework tree will make all this crap go away,
    so I think we can tolerate the extra #ifdef for the next release.

    Fix problems with vertex program protocol
    
    There were two sets of bugs in the vertex program (ARB and NV)
    protocol.  First, several of the ARB functions were missing the
    'doubles_in_order="true"' annotation.  Second, after the ARB decided
    that glVertexAttrib*ARB functions must not alias fixed-function state
    for GLSL, Nvidia re-assigned GLX protocol opcodes for
    glVertexAttrib*NV (circa Septeber 2004).  For some reason gl_API.xml
    was never updated to reflect this, and the updated version of the
    GL_NV_vertex_program spec never made into the registry.
    
    This is just a server-side regeneration from gl_API.xml version 1.68.

    Finish support for GL_ARB_texture_compression.
    
    Fill in __glXDisp_GetCompressedTexImageARB and
    __glXDispSwap_GetCompressedTexImageARB to finish support for
    GL_ARB_texture_compression.  With this extension (and the related
    compression extensions), the server-side GLX supports all of the
    protocol for GL 1.4.  w00t!
    
    The bad news is that this has received only minimal testing, and Mesa
    does not contain any good tests for GL_ARB_texture_compression.

    Fix absolute button events in GPE, where we would previously send valuator
    events without bumping numEvents accordingly, causing the core event to

    In the non-XKB path in GKVE, implement proper lock behaviour (one press to
    enable, one press to disable, discard releases).
    Fix debug_events prototype.

    rather than the pointer to the filter (per-screen state).

    called on source pictures.

    Bug #7366: Fix two crashes in operations on source pictures.
    
    A screen's ChangePictureTransform now isn't called when changing the transform,
    as source pictures aren't associated with screens.  Also, attempting to set
    an AlphaMap to a source picture will fail with BadMatch just like a Window
    would, preventing another crash.

    Bug #7381: Coordinates get wrapped in accelerated line drawing on pixmap
    
    XAAPolylinesWideSolid was adding the drawable origin onto each element in the
    pPts array.  Since the values got stored back into the pPts array, they got
    truncated to 16 bits, causing the overflow I saw.  This patch avoids storing
    the coords back into the pPts array (and actually reduces the size of the
    code too :).  Now the 32-bit sum of coords + origin doesn't get truncated to
    16 bits, and the problem is solved.

    Remove the default case from fbcompose.c switches which should cover all cases.
    
    Instead, stick the NULL return default case afterwards, so that the compiler can
    warn us when we've got unimplemented cases.  Removes some unimplemented and
    unused 8bpp, depth 4 picture format names.

    Add explicit dependencies (Xorg_DEPENDENCIES = ) on the internal libraries

commit 53f74b6aa95fe57fda45fd8a051595e772f00402
Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@FreeBSD.org>
Date:   Fri Jun 16 10:14:30 2006 -0700

    Bugzilla #5120, #7246: In CW's GC ops, validate the backing GC against the
    backing drawable if the serial numbers differ.  Fixes crash in XAA which
    occurred when the DDX bumped the serial number on the backing drawable and
    expected it to get re-validated, and we didn't because the wrapped drawable
    hadn't been bumped.

    Move probe_devices_from_device_sections,
    add_matching_devices_to_configure_list, and check_for_matching_devices
    from xf86Helper.c to xf86Init.c.  These functions are only called from
    a single place in xf86Init.c, so it makes sense for them to live
    there.  They were originally in xf86Helper.c because they evolved out
    another function that was already in that file.

    passed 0 as the function.  That was a mistake.

        XFree86LOADER ifdefs, non-loadable hasn't been supported for a while

    Add Polylines and PolyPoint acceleration as well. This is primarily to
        clean up fallback debugging output, so I can focus on more imporant
        cases. Performance is comparable but without hardware stalls, and
        passes Xlib9.

    Improve EXA fallback debugging output to include the locations of pixmaps.
        This is being used in tracking down recent compositing performance

    Add trivial PolySegment acceleration for 0-width horizontal/vertical lines,
        which still happen somewhat frequently and were cluttering up my
        fallback debugging output. x11perf says it's a major performance win in
        those cases (though probably irrelevant), and it passes Xlib9.

    In drawing glyphs, shortcut our way to exaComposite instead of going
        through the whole CompositePicture stack and doing things like
        computing damage over again. This is a sizeable win for text drawing

        with the scratch pixmap when we are able to do UploadToScreen
        successfully and never need it.

    Add a helper for the Component Alpha Over case, which breaks the operation
        down into an OutReverse and an Add. Turn off the fallback to software
        glyphs when component alpha, now that we expect all (new) drivers to be
        able to support it. Also, make Xephyr fall back in the CA Over case to
        exercise this code. This speeds up my rgb24text and ls -lR in
        gnome-terminal by a factor of 5.

    Fix a bug in the intersection computation that could concievably cause
        incorrect results to be returned (but would probably usually be
        over-conservative).

    Bug #4668: Check if the lists of glyphs don't have any intersecting glyphs,
        and if they all have a maskFormat matching the format of the actual
        glyphs If so, we can avoid the temporary pixmap for accumulating
        glyphs, which reduces the number of operations done, and makes it
        easier on the migration system. This fixes some significant performance
        issues, particularly with subpixel antialiasing. Note that it does
        increase the amount of damage computation which is done, so is not
        always a win with a compositing manager running.

    Add an option to verify at the point of migration that pixmaps which aren't
        marked dirty are in fact not dirty. This will hopefully help catch
        issues like the previous commit. Leave it on in fakexa.

    Missed in previous commit: Add a new migration scheme, called "Smart" for
        lack of a better name. This one behaves somewhat between Greedy and
        Always. It moves in if we can accelerate, unless the destination is
        clean and shouldn't be kept in framebuffer according to the score, in
        which case we migrate out (and force-migrate anything where migration
        is free). This should help fix lack of acceleration for drivers without
        UTS since removing exaAsyncPixmapGCOps, and has removed one performance
        trap with Radeon I'd noticed. It is the new default.

    Add an option to EXA for the DDX to request that EXA hide the pixmap's
        devPrivate.ptr when pointing at offscreen memory, outside of
        exaPrepare/FinishAccess(). This was used with fakexa to find (by NULL
        dereference) many instances of un-Prepared CPU access to the
        framebuffer:
    - GC tiles used in several ops when fillStyle == FillTiled were never
        Prepared.
    - Migration could lead to un-Prepared access to mask data in render's
        Trapezoids and Triangles
    - PutImage's UploadToScreen failure fallback failed to Prepare.

    Remove the exaAsyncPixmapGCOps mostly-unaccelerated ops vector, and always
        plug in the accelerated one, even if the destination pixmap is
        currently offscreen. This was a leftover from when kaa originally got
        accelerated offscreen pixmap support, and its only concievable use was
        to avoid a little overhead on ops to in-system pixmaps that weren't
        going to get migrated. At this point, we probably care more about just
        getting everything accelerated that we easily can, which should happen
        with the new migration support.

    Bug #2986: Add PutImage acceleration for the ZPixmap, planeMask ~=
        FB_ALLONES, bitsPerPixel >= 8, GXcopy cases. With the radeon driver on
        my machine, this gives about 10% speedup in PutImage
    10x10 and 500x500, and 40% speedup for 10x10 ShmPutImage, up to 65%
        improvement in 500x500 ShmPutImage. Also fixes a crasher in GetImage
        that slipped in at the last minute.

    Bug #2986: Add acceleration of GetImage using DownloadFromScreen for the
        ZPixmap, planeMask ~= FB_ALLONES, bitsPerPixel >= 8 case. I'm pretty

    Add a DownloadFromScreen implementation, used for testing GetImage

        this is all for testing, and Always should make migration happen more
        frequently than Greedy).

    Change EXA so that exaMoveOutPixmap() retains the framebuffer copy of the
        pixmap, and damage is tracked so that a later exaMoveInPixmap won't
        result in an upload if no upload is necessary. This will likely improve
        the performance of the "Always" migration scheme significantly, and is
        a step in the path to more exact damage tracking between framebuffer
        and system memory.

    Add a new migration scheme, "always", which will move pixmaps to their
        desired location always (unless they don't fit in FB, in which case
        they all get moved out for software rendering). The default remains as
        before, but can be controlled by the MigrationHeuristic xorg.conf
        option (which is intentionally not documented, as it may be
        short-lived). This is part of the exa-damagetrack work, which appears
        stable in testing with fakexa, unlike the work as a whole.

        current GetImage and GetSpans not being accelerated.

    If fakexa is enabled, create a larger buffer in the Ximage, but keep the
        same width/height for front-buffer drawing. The fakexa code then uses
        this extra space for offscreen pixmaps. Note that this tones down the
        absurdity of fakexa's offscreen pixmap alignment requirements (odd
        alignment is too weird, so stick with "24", which is still strange but
        exists out there). It also fixes a couple of bugs in the fakexa
        implementation revealed by using offscreen pixmaps.

        pMask is non-NULL but pMask->pDrawable is NULL. This prevents NULL
        dereferences on gradients and other Pictures which have no pDrawable.

    Commit changes missed in last commit (mis-typed path and didn't notice): Do
        a first pass of doxygen documentation of EXA. This removes the
        corresponding pieces of exa-driver.txt, which were becoming stale.
        Hopefully the documentation will stay much more up-to-date this way.
        Many thanks to jbarnes for writing exa-driver.txt which was used a lot
        in writing this documentation.

commit 2822cbc1fb2271844e7ae10c3629aaa940ae4042
Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@freebsd.org>
Date:   Thu Mar 9 06:04:07 2006 +0000

    Rearrange EXA driver structures so that there's a hope of maintaining ABI
        when extending the driver interface. The card and accel structures are
        merged into the ExaDriverRec, which is to be allocated using
        exaDriverAlloc(). The driver structure also grows exa_major and
        exa_minor, which drivers fill in and have checked by EXA
        (double-checking that the driver really did check that the EXA version
        was correct). Removes exaInitCard(), which is replaced by the driver
        filling in the rec by hand, and the exaGetVersion() and related
        EXA_*VERSION which are replaced by always using the XFree86 loadable
        module versioning.

    render/picture.c Initialize the format of a source picture to
        PICT_a8r8g8b8. Fixes a failure in the gradients test of rendercheck. In
        the long term we could do better by setting the format to something
        without alpha whenever the gradient doesn't contain colors with alpha.
        This triggers a reduction of the over operation to a pure source
        operation.

    Numerous amounts refactoring and comment adding (see ChangeLog for file by

Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@freebsd.org>
Date:   Tue Mar 7 19:57:46 2006 +0000

    Add a new flag to ephyr, "-fakexa", which turns on an EXA acceleration
        implementation that calls fb to get its work done. The purpose is to
        have a trusted EXA driver for use with testing changes to the core of
        EXA. However, fakexa has not received much testing yet, lacks offscreen
        pixmaps support, and doesn't reliably provide garbage when EXA doesn't
        get its syncing right. All of these should be fixed soon.

Date:   Tue Feb 21 00:02:08 2006 +0000

    Eliminate unused PCI BIOS reading functionality. The old code used several
        function pointers to implement a level of flexability that was never
        used. The code also had unused support for extracting a single image
        type from a larger expansion ROM.
    Fix the spelling of PCI_BIOS_OPEN_FIRMWARE.
    Fix a couple errors in #ifdef debug code.
    These changes have been tested on x86 and x86-64 Linux.

    Eliminate all the code for querying the PCI class from the PCI ID database.
        Class information is not, and never has been, stored there. Therefore,
        this is just a bunch of elaborate code to read 0x00000000.
    This has received testing on x86 and x86-64 Linux.

    Fix an occasional crash on VT switches: the server would save a pointer to
        the current cursor when disabling FB access and would try to restore
        that cursor when re-enabling. However, that cursor might have been
        destroyed in between. This fixes it by updating the saved cursor
        pointer when a cursor is set and vtSema is FALSE.

    Move EXA implementation up to the top level and remove its XFree86
        dependencies. It was nearly abstract enough already to be used by
        multiple DDXes. This will be useful for EXA development through
        providing a fake acceleration implementation within Xephyr, so that
        testing can be done on new EXA code without worrying about buggy
        drivers.

    Remove the waitSync from KdDisableScreen and push it off to drivers'
        disableAccel hook, which is more correct anyway. This makes kdrive.c

        kdrive.

    DRIGetSecs() would call getsecs() when XFree86LOADER is defined, relying on
        the wrappers to provide it. Wrapper gone, and getsecs doesn't exist on
        linux so it now blows up. Fixes it by just calling gettimeofday() in
        all cases instead.

    Add all subdirs used to DIST_SUBDIRS, and files to EXTRA_DIST.
    Attempt to build xeglmodule.c, not xglxmodule.c.
    Add xf86Sbus.h to EXTRA_DIST, as _HEADERS doesn't appear to get the same
        treatment as _SOURCES in terms of automatically DISTing.

    Move drawable lock acquisition into DRIClipNotify from DRIValidateTree, so
        we only take it when clipping a DRI drawable instead of on every tree
        update. Note drawable lock acquisition per- screen instead of globally,
        and drop it in BlockHandler if necessary.

    Add glyph privates for Xgl, which uses them to implement a glyph cache. EXA
        would probably also like to do this. This breaks module ABI for EXA and
        XAA, and likely breaks proprietary drivers as well.

    Change REGION_INIT(pScreen, &foo, NullBox, 0) to REGION_NULL(pScreen,
        &foo). While it is no longer (or rather, once again not) required as of
        regionstr.h r1.4, it matches the style of the rest of the xorg code.

    Initialize the fourcc value in stack-allocated glitz_pixel_format_t
        structures. Greatly reduces the number of uninitialized-value accesses
        during Xgl startup according to valgrind. Allocating and filling these
        in by hand on the stack seems very shady to me.

    Fix the AC_TRY_RUN for sys/linker.h which had no hope due to lacking a
        main() to instead use a nice AC_CHECK_HEADERS that works. Also, fix the
        nearby SYSV IPC check which was lacking an argument and giving bogus
        results (it's "AC_TRY_LINK(includes, main, yes, no)").

    Add necessary *CONFIG_H declarations and a force-off of XF86* extensions in
        miinitext in the XGL case. Prevents mismatched structure sizes on my

    RandR: Add a driver func to let the driver determine the physical size of a
        screen size (display mode). Useful for faked widescreen modes, modes
        which are scaled by the driver, etc. This really helps fixing RandR's
        sometimes dumb DPI assumptions.

    Add an additional meaning to the "dirty" flag. Now, if !dirty && !area, the
        pixmaps's contents are undefined, so we won't need to upload the
        undefined contents in MoveIn. Use the ExaCheck* for async ops as well,
        so that dirty is always tracked. While the performance impact for my ls
        -lR test was not significant (though the avoiding-upload path was being
        hit), it's likely to be important for the upcoming Get/PutImage
        acceleration from ajax.

    Fix a couple of bugs in the offscreen allocator. One mostly harmless was
        causing our search loop for evictable blocks to possibly skip a good
        candiate, and another was the allocator would occasionally use
        area->offset as if it was the base of the pixmap, while for a pixmap
        that is not in available state, it is not. This caused some funny
        miscalculation leading to overlapping pixmaps and accesses beyond the
        end of the framebuffer. To make things cleared, I renamed save_offset
        to base_offset, made sure it's the one used everywhere in the
        allocator, and only align "offset" for the client at the end of
        exaOffscreenAlloc().

    Don't try the accelerated glyphs path for component-alpha text (which I
        don't expect drivers to be able to accelerate without exa assistance).
        Instead, drop back to plain old miGlyphs for a 62.5% +/- 1.5% reduction
        in runtime of my ls -lR test (n=5) with component alpha. While a
        reasonable approach would seem to be making a better test to see
        whether the entire path would be accelerated and force migration
        appropriately, my attempt at this made the situation much worse.

    Clients tend to set picture->repeat when not necessary. Most HW cannot
        accelerate repeat NPOT thus triggering software fallback (this is the
        case with gnome desktop for example). This adds a simple optimisation
        to exa that removes "repeat" when it's obviously useless, that is, the
        single picture instance covers the entire rectangle beeing used

    Bugzilla #4616:
    - Merge various fb/ bits of COMPOSITE support from xserver, which weren't
        necessary before due to cw hiding the issues. Fixes offset calculations
        for a number of operations, and may pull some fixes that cairo has
        wanted for XAA as well.
    - Add a new call, miDisableCompositeWrapper(), which a DDX can call to keep
        cw from getting initialized from the damage code. While it would be
        cleaner to have each DDX initialize it if it needs it, we don't have
        control over all of them (e.g. nvidia).
    - Use the miDisableCompositeWrapper() to keep cw from getting set up for
        screens using EXA, because EXA is already aware of composite. Avoiding
        cw improved performance 0-35% on operations tested by ajax in x11perf.

    Refactors __glXImageSize and __glXImage3DSize into a single function. It
        replaces all calls to the old functions with calls to __glXImageSize
        with the new parameter list.
    I have also added 'target' as a parameter. This is a stepping stone to the
        code in patch #2410. Basically, if the texture target is one of
        GL_PROXY_*, the image size is always zero. This gathers all the checks
        for that into a single place. I have *not* modified the existing
        callers to take this into account. They still do their own checks for
        GL_PROXY_*. However, when the generated versions of those functions are
        added to the tree, they *will* rely on that.
    The code growth is mainly due to the new 40 line comment before
        __glXImageSize.
    I have tested this with a few of the texture using demos and tests from
        Mesa, including tunnel, texdown, and drawpix.

    Fix some problems that caused incorrectly annotated prototypes for
        __gl*_size functions to be used. The result was that, on x86, the code
        would be compiled with FASTCALL semantics, but the callers would not.
        This should fix GLX protocol errors that people are seeing. There
        doesn't appear to be a bugzilla associated with this problem.

    - Change migration-in rule slightly: previously, if your score was less
        than the max, it was bumped, and then if you were above the threshhold
        you got moved in. Instead, do the above-threshhold check separate from
        score starting out less than max. While this will likely make thrashing
        cases worse, I hope it will fix some issues with long term performance
        (think of an xcompmgr with a backbuffer it's doing only accelerated
        operations to. If some new pixmap comes in and bumps it out, even once,
        it will never get a chance to re-migrate because its score will be
        maxed). Change migration-out to be the same way for symmetry, though it
        shouldn't ever affect anything.
    - Fix a lot of debugging output, both in terms of printing quality, and
        completeness. The fallback debugging covers a lot more now, pointing
        out new areas for improvement. Debugging toggles are now centralized in
        exaPriv.h.

    Add support for hardware accelerating tiled background painting. One
        example of this is the root weave, which paints slightly slower on SiS
        now in my testing. However, according to keithp some apps use this
        feature for a sort of cheap backing store, which this could help with
        significantly. While I haven't done much performance testing with it,
        it will at least rule out one possible source of terrible performance.

    Break EXA ABI while we still can. Add coordinates to the UploadToScreen
        hook so we can upload a subset of a pixmap, and convert the current
        drivers to respect that. Use this support to directly UploadToScreen in
        exaGlyphs, providing a 47.4% +/-2.4% decrease in wall time for ls -lR
        programs/Xserver in an antialiased gnome-terminal on an M6 (n=3, caches
        hot). I would have bumped major version, only I can't tell what the
        EXA_VERSION_* is supposed to be doing as opposed to the module version.

    - Don't try to upload 0 byte-per-pixel (PICT_a1) data using
        RADEONHostDataBlit.
    - Disable the shortcut for switching from 3d to 3d in radeon_exa.c. It
        appears that we do need the cache flush here, thought it's not clear
        why. Disable the 2d to 2d shortcut while here, since I'm unsure of what
        we're doing. Exposed by the following bit:
    - Bug #4485: Add a new routine, exaGlyphs, to handle font drawing. Glyphs
        were being accumulated in from non-migratable scratch pixmaps, causing
        the destination pixmap to move towards screen but the migration
        necessary for source never to happen, leading to abysmal performance.
        Instead, copy the scratch glyph data into a real pixmap first, then
        composite from that into the destination, allowing for migration. time
        ls -lR from programs/Xserver showed 26.9% (+/- 6.3%) decrease in wall
        time (n=3).
    - Create exaDrawableUse* wrapping exaPixmapUse*, but which are aware of
        windows needing backing store. Makes migration code prettier, and
        ensures that composited windows will be migrated as normal when we turn
        off cw for EXA. (issue brought up by keithp)

    Don't define POSIX_SOURCE on any BSDs, since it breaks things.
    Define NO_SYS_HEADERS, as the monolithic build does. Helps FreeBSD.
    Don't include validate.c in the library, since it seems to be a userland
        test program.

    Add a pair of hooks, PrepareAccess() and FinishAccess(), which get called
        around CPU access to the framebuffer. This allows the hardware to set
        up swappers to deal with endianness, or to tell EXA to move the pixmap
        out to framebuffer if insufficient swappers are available (note: must
        not fail on front buffer!).

    Remove existing broken maxX/maxY code for composite (results in infinite
        loops, doesn't deal with failure, doesn't present the interface to
        drivers that I expected) and instead replace it with a simple fallback
        to software when coordinate limits could be violated. Act similarly in
        other acceleration cases as well.
    The solution I want to see (and intend to do soon) is to (when necessary)
        create temporary pictures/pixmaps pointing towards the real ones' bits,
        with the offsets adjusted, then render from/to those using adjusted
        coordinates.

    Bugzilla #4226: Change the pixmap migration strategy for the CopyNtoN case.
        Now, if either source or dest were in framebuffer, try to get both
        there, but prefer system memory for both otherwise. Required making
        exaasync.c go through the try-acceleration path. This significantly
        improves window resizing under composite, because previously the
        pattern of creating a new pixmap and copying default contents from the
        screen caused a fallback every time due to the new destination pixmap
        being in system memory.

    Huge cleanup. Group into sections: hardware feature detection, extension
        detection/configuration, DDX options. Make building of Xorg DDX fully
        optional. Clarify and correct some help texts. Change all comments to
        use dnl instead of #. Quote all tests correctly, and guard
        pure-variable tests with 'x' (e.g. test $DMX = yes -> test "x$DMX" =
        xyes). Since the DDXes seem to have pretty divergent extension support
        these days, get rid of EXTENSION_LIBS, DMX_EXTENSIONS and
        XPRINT_EXTENSIONS, and go back to building extension lists by hand in
        the DDX-specific sections. Use portable POSIX constructs everywhere
        (e.g. test foo && test bar, instead of test foo -a bar).
    Clean up old cruft.
    Set _XSERVER64 on 64-bit architectures, and use x86_64 for host_cpu instead
        of amd64 (Jürg Billeter).

    Use '$(DRMSRCDIR)/shared-core' instead of '$(DRMSRCDIR)/shared' for DRM
        includes. This matches the way drivers are built in the Mesa tree and
        fixes a build problem in the Savage driver.
    Convert uses of __glPointParameterfvARB_size to
        __glPointParameterfvEXT_size and uses of __glPointParameteriv_size to
        __glPointParameterivNV_size. This eliminates the need to hand-edit
        indirect_size.c after it is generated.

        <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/attachment.cgi?id=3058>
    08-Jul-2005 nv driver updates from Mark Vojkovich:
    Change some console restore code for NV11. Hopefully, we can more reliably
        restore the console for desktop systems using DVI. This may correct a
        recent regression on NV11.
    Also, new PCI IDs.
    Add new nVidia PCI ids to match nv_driver.c changes.

    Changed the semantics of the Convolution filter a bit. It now doesn't try

        parameters sum up to 0.

    Add support for gradients and solid fills to Render.
    Changed the semantics of the Convolution filter a bit. It now doesn't try
        to normalize the filter values but leaves this to the client. This
        gives more reasonable behaviour in the limit where the filter
        parameters sum up to 0.

    Greatly improve the correctness and performance of the MGA render
        implementation. Includes cache flushing to prevent bad first reads of
        the framebuffer, fixing blending of many formats, falling back on many
        unsupported operations, and falling back early to prevent migration.
        Passes all of rendercheck except some of the blend (!) tests.

    TSLib fixes. Add fullscreen support to ephyr

commit 545c082cf9c86f2a809ea6b4dca33643afb0c3d3
Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@freebsd.org>
Date:   Thu Jun 9 10:44:45 2005 +0000

    - Replace the syncAccel hook in the kdrive structure with a pair of hooks
        in the kaa structure: markSync and waitMarker. The first, if set,
        returns a hardware-dependent marker number which can then be waited for
        with waitMarker. If markSync is absent (which is the case on all
        drivers currently), waitMarker must wait for idle on any given marker
        number. The intention is to allow for more parallelism when we get
        downloading from framebuffer, or more fine-grained idling.
    - Replace the KdMarkSync/KdCheckSync functions with kaaMarkSync and
        kaaWaitSync. These will need to be refined when KAA starts being smart
        about using them. Merge kpict.c into kasync.c since kasyn.c has all the
        rest of these fallback funcs.
    - Restructure all drivers to initialize a KaaInfo structure by hand rather
        than statically in dubious order.
    - Whack the i810 driver into shape in hopes that it'll work after this
        change (it certainly wouldn't have before this). Doesn't support my
        i845 though.
    - Make a new KXV helper to avoid duplicated code to fill the region with
        the necessary color key. Use it in i810 and mach64 (tested).

    VBESetVBEMode() calls int10 0x4f02 to set a VBE video mode. This can be a
        standard mode solely determined by the mode ID or it may be a detailed
        mode with almost arbitrary mode parameters. The mode parameters are
        passed to the BIOS in a memory area pointed to by es:di. If bit 11 in
        the video mode is set this memory area is evaluated. When we don't have
        such an area (passed to VBESetVBEMode() this function should unset this
        bit for sanity reasons. (Bugzilla #3329)

    A. Avoid that *SyncStart starts before *BlankStart. If *BlankStart >
    *SyncStart it is made = *SyncStart and its width is made maximal but such
        that the blank does not exceed *Total. Since the Sync width has the
        same restrictions as the Blank width monitors should still be able to
        clamp after the sync pulse. B. Over time mode validation has become
        inconsistent when people started to add additional features to the mode
        validation. One such feature is that the mode->Crtc* values have been
        (ab)used to allow the driver ValidMode() function to pass driver
        normalized timing values back to the validation function. The
        introduction of these features made the code less readable and created
        numerous possibly unintended side effects in the validation semantics.
        I've attempted to consolidate these changes making the code more
        consistent and eliminating a number of side effects. This should not
        cause problems for the majority of drivers, still it should receive
        testing - especially with ATi Mach64 and Radeon code. (Bugzilla #3325).

    Don't fail calling function when DriverFunc() for RandR fails as
        DriverFunc() also returns FALSE when the specific sub function isn't
        supported. In the case of xf86RandRGetInfo() we simply rely on what has
        been set before and return TRUE. In the case of xf86RandRSetConfig() we
        only bail with FALSE if we have to do a rotation and the call fails. We
        presently cannot do rotation on the fly without the help of a driver
        function (Bugzilla #2745).

    Add an OUT_RING_REG macro for use with DMA_PACKET0, which is like OUT_RING
        but includes debugging to ensure that the reg being submitted is the
        one that follows in the packet. Convert most uses of OUT_RING to it,
        and convert a couple of OUT_REG sets to DMA_PACKET0/OUT_RING_REG. Also,
        add checking to see if more registers are submitted to a DMA_PACKET0
        than should be, to avoid hangs during stupid mistakes (checking for
        less isn't done).

    When we tested if a PCI base address was unassigned we didn't take into
        account that this bar could have been the upper part of a 64bit base
        address. This fix makes this code 64bit bar aware (Bugzilla #2382).

    Rewrite of RemoveOverlaps() to make the code more readable. It was
        virtually impossible to determine if the old code did what it was
        supposed to do. Also changed paradigm: Trust the based address more
        than the (guessed) size. (Bugzilla #2383)

    Add a set of macros for dealing with the repeated code to wait for a while
        reading a register/attempting DMA. Now it'll wait for a certain number
        of seconds rather than a certain number of times through the loop
        before deciding that it's timed out and resetting the hardware. Also,
        add more timeout handling, and reset the draw state after resetting the
        engine.

    Let the OS instead of X save/restore text console fonts on Linux. So far we
        relied on the generic VGA layer to restore text console fonts for us
        when shutting down the server or VT switching back to the text console.
        This has worked rather well but it has some downsides on Linux: a. Many
        people use fbdev as console text mode. In this case it is not necessary
        to save/restore console fonts as the console is running in graphics
        mode anyway. b. Some architectures don't have a fbdev console but
        require a full POST of even the primary card (ie. IA64). This posting
        has to take place before we even have a chance to save anything.
        Therefore the fonts we save are the once written to the chip by POST,
        not what has been programmed by the user. c. Certain chipsets utilize
        the BIOS to perform mode setting. This may interfer with the vga
        save/restore font function in a strange way. It would therefore be
        preferrable to let the OS - which has been used to set up the font in
        the first place - take care of saving/restoring the data. I will attach
        a patch which will do so for Linux. To make this fully functional a
        small patch needs to be applied to the Linux kernel. To disable this
        feature add: #define DoOSFontRestore NO to your host.def. (Bugzilla
        #2277)

    Clean-ups and support for AMD64. Bug 1067. Patch by Nicholas Miell
        (nmiell@comcast.net)
    Add support for AMD64
    Many cleanups using <mmintrin.h> instead of __builin_ia32_*, and intrinsics
        instead of inline assembly. Also unconditionally use pshufw on AMD64.

    Back out the previous day's broken R200 "fix" -- the same number of coords
        are always emitted. Fix the real problem, which was not enough regs
        being initialized in ati_draw.c. Fix a typo that was resulting in alpha
        coming out as 0 * src or 0 * broken instead of src * 1 or src * mask.
        Assign the blending results to R0, as appears to be necessary. Unbreak
        the dst-alpha-blend-with-no-dst-alpha code. Yow. And set the right DMA
        count for the r200 traps code.

    Fix r200 render (for real this time?) by setting tex1_comp_cnt right for
        non-mask rendering. Reenable it. Also, R200TexFormats was used instead
        of R100 in one place. Harmless so far, because the formats were in the
        same order.

    Make Xorg the default server to install.
    Avoid PIO access on IA64. Some IA64 machine check if legacy ports outside
        the VGA range are accessed. The ATi driver however does this to probe
        for ISA Mach8/32/64. Since no IA64 has ISA slots this restriction
        should not be relevant to the user.
    Avoid recursive calls of xf86scanpci(). This function normally detects that
        it has been called before by checking if the PCI structure is filled
        out. So far if this was not the case (because PCI probing has failed
        for some reason) the function is traversed again. With the chipset
        specific PCI bus probing this can lead to an endless recursive loop as
        the post-probing code calls xf86scanpci() from within this function.
    The OS specific PCI code for Linux worked only if bus 0 was populated as it
        checked for the presence of /proc/bus/pci/00. Fixed to check for
        /proc/bus/pci/<bus_to_look_for> instead.

    Fix for https://freedesktop.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1664 - RFE: Add
        support for the DOUBLE-BUFFER extension to the Xprint server and DDX.
        Additionally a "pixmap-scrubber" optimisation is added to the
        PostScript DDX to remove all content from a vector pixmap when a
        |PolyFillRect()| call covers the whole pixmap surface with a solid fill
        (this avoids that a backbuffer vector pixmap gets constantly filled
        even when the content is not visible anymore after |XdbeSwapBuffers()|
        has cleared the hidden buffer with the background color).

    Made handling of DevelDrivers for x86-64 more conformant to other
        platforms.
    Compress all font encodings (Stefan Dirsch).
    Fixed warnings.
    Turn on forwarding XNSpotLocation event to XIM server in OffTheSpot and
        Root mode (bugzilla #1580, James Su).
    Added another compose key combination for the Euro symbol (Stefan Dirsch).
    Added support for UTF-8 in ja_JP, ko_KR and zh_TW locales (Mike Fabian).
    Changed default encoding for ru from KOI8-R to ISO8859-5 (Mike Fabian).
        This is the encoding that is also used by glibc. We may break other
        libcs - lets see who complains.
    Added explanation for DESTDIR to install to a different directory than /.
    Added some early bailouts to atiprobe if PCI structure pointer is NULL to
        prevent sig11.
    XV support doesn't depend on 2D acceleration any more. This patch removes
        this limitation from the NSC driver. This is a patch that I have
        committed to XFree86 a while ago but never ported over to X.Org.
        Matthieu Herrb contributed some build fixes.
    Fixing SetDPMSTimers() so that DPMS*Time == 0 disables the appropriate
        timer. This takes advantage of the fact that TimerSet() with a timeout
        argument 0 behaves like TimerCanel().
    Use /dev/xconsole (named pipe) or devpts for system logger (Werner Fink).
    Create missing links for backward compatibility to XFree86 (Stefan Dirsch).
    Changed comment to mention xorg.
    Changed cursor for the 'kill' action from XC_draped_box to XC_Pirate. If
        you don't like it we can change it back (original author unkown).
    Added 'pic' to the man page rendering command pipeline (Werner Fink).
    Added missing return value (Stefan Dirsch, Roland Mainz)

    When I wrote the resource code 5 years ago I made some assumptions which
        turned out to be false: I've assumed that the bus number of the PCI
        hostbridge would be the PCI bus the bridge links to. This is not
        correct. Fixing this assumption is not easy. However I hope that the
        attached patch will make the system work regardless as it 'ignores'
        host bridges from which the target bus is not known. This should not
        matter at all as we really don't care about host bridges (unless we
        have bridge specific code which retrieves information about the
        bridge).
    Fixed server crash on reset when a structure allocated in PreInit() was

    Fixed numerous warnings due to signed unsigned comparisons.

    Adding support for OS dependent probing of IA64 chipsets. Not all IA64
        chipsets can be probed without OS support as probing them is only
        possible using ACPI. One example of this are the HP ZX1/2 chipsets:
        previously the code assumed that these chips were present when no other
        of the known chipsets could be probed. This assumption brought SGI
        Altrix machines with 64 CPUs to a grinding halt.

    - Add disabled WIP trapezoid code for R128 and R100. The R128 rendering is
        not doing an add of 1 per triangle like I hoped, and instead seems to
        be saturating all the pixels or something. The R100 acceleration
        renders pretty well, with some gaps. Note that both are slower than
        software due to lack of DMA to submit vertices.
    - Mostly fix R128 and Radeon transform support, including supporting
        bilinear filtering on R128. Subpixel offsets are still probably an
        issue (reported by rendercheck), but I want to make 100% sure about my
        understanding of the protocol before changing everybody, including fb.
    - Add support for dst formats without alpha to R128 Composite.
    - Remove the R128 Blend code, which has long outlived its usefulness. (I
        kept it around for one reason: It could be useful for the w/h > 1024
        case with no mask and a non-src op. That seems pretty infrequent and
        not worth the trouble).

    Add a set of three hooks for accelerating trapezoids, and use it for the
        RasterizeTrapezoid screen function. These hooks will be called for
        imprecise, non-sharp trapezoids with A8 destinations.
    Note that the current main consumer of trapezoids, cairo, is requesting
        precise, sharp trapezoids by not changing the default Picture
        attributes, but gets non-sharp effects in software because fb bases its
        choice of sharp/non-sharp on the mask format being A8 vs A1, and cairo
        asks for A8. Follow fb's (poor?) example by ignoring the sharp setting
        and basing the choice off of the mask being A8.

    Rather than initially place pixmaps in framebuffer based on a size
        heuristic, delay the decision until the first
        kaaPixmapUse{Screen|Memory}, and put it in framebuffer if UseScreen was
        called. Provides a significant improvement in cairo speeds (100%
        speedup in cairogears here) and is likely to improve text performance
        as well.

    Bug #1101: Fix PaintWindow in the pixmap case when the window's origin is
        not at the backing pixmap's origin. Resulted in incorrect rendering in
        at least aisleriot, fluxbox, and KDE apps, and probably many more.
        While here, move the ParentRelative loop above the drawable grab -- may
        improve correctness with ParentRelative background origins as well.
        Note that the border code doesn't handle ParentRelative yet.

    Bug #1138: Wrap funcs in CW's GC ops as well. While this is unnecessary
        according to the rules as I understand them (bug #1045), not everybody
        follows the rules. GC funcs were being called on the same GC from
        within GC ops, and the cwValidateGC caused a loop in the funcs chain
        that resulted in a crash, notably in cwPolylines.

    Clip destination instead of source. Should be the same, but it looks nicer
        to me.
    Clean up transition between cheap and expensive GC wrappers by using the

        sometimes which would cause all kinds of entertaining bugs against a
        DDX which cares (XAA).

    Apply a kludge to initialize the composite wrapper before DamageSetup. If
        not, DamageSetup will wrap some operations first, and the cw
        initializes during ExtensionInit, so cw comes higher in the wrapping
        chain. cw going first will result in damage getting confused when the
        drawables get changed around.

    - Fix wrapping of GC ops/funcs according to policy described in bug #1045.
    - Remove ValidateGC/ValidatePictures on the redirected drawables/pictures
        -- it's not needed, and DDXs shouldn't be seeing redirected drawables
        in render or GC ops/funcs when cw is running.
    - Mark all GC/Picture state as dirty when moving from redirected to
        non-redirected, since it hadn't been passed down in Change* or
        Validate* while redirected.
    - Remove CreatePicture wrapper that didn't do anything.
    - Comment on why AddTraps wrapper isn't needed.

    - Add a new Render function, CopyPicture, which will update a picture with
        the flagged bits from a source picture. Approved in principle by
        keithp.
    - Use CopyPicture and SetTransform to update most of the backing picture's
        state in the composite wrapper. Filters are still missing.
    - Don't allocate a picture private, now that we calculate clipping properly
        and don't need the serialNumber or stateChanges.
    - Use the format of the source pixmap rather than generating the format
        from the window's visual.
    - Wrap the rest of the Render primitives that were stubbed out before.

    - Always validate the backing GC in cwValidateGC, not just when the clip
        list changes.
    - Use FillTiled instead of FillSolid for painting tiled border/background
        pixmaps, and don't needlessly change the scratch GC's defaults.
    - Use the preferred dixChangeGC instead of DoChangeGC.
    - Simplify a silly loop and clean up a couple of comments.

    - Add two new XAA hooks, SetupForCPUToScreenTexture2 and
        SetupForCPUToScreenAlphaTexture2. These add a dstFormat argument after
        the previous format argument, which the driver needs to use to properly
        set up the destination format. Two new arrays are added for the list of
        destination formats supported that correspond to the previous format
        arrays for sources.
    - Make Render acceleration only occur when the new hook for that
        acceleration type is supplied and the dst format list is set, along
        with the src format list being set. Without knowing the destination
        format, the Render acceleration couldn't properly support all the
        destinations it might encounter.
    - Bump XAA module minor version.
    - Update the Radeon Render acceleration to use the new hooks when the XAA
        module is sufficiently new. Fix a bug in the src/dst alpha booleans for
        ops, and use them to set blend_cntl to support destinations without
        alpha. Add missing PICT_a1r5g5b5 texture format, and add list
        terminator. (!)

    Major improvements to Composite wrapper. Several issues remain, but it now
        appears stable in limited testing.
    - Allocate the picture private, avoiding segfault.
    - Wrap PaintWindow to draw the background/border to the backing pixmap
        (based on Deron Johnson's comptran.c).
    - Set the x_off/y_off returns to translate coordinates properly.
    - Don't bother allocating temporary areas for the modified coordinates.
        Layers above are responsible for handling lower layers changing the
        arguments, so cw doesn't have to worry about it. mibstore.c has to do
        the allocation because it calls down twice (front buffer and backing
        store). (Suggested by keithp)
    - Handle the mode argument to PolyPoint, Polylines, and FillPolygon.
    - Remove some dead elements in the cw privates.
    - Kill a prototype warning in compinit.c by adding the cw.h header.

    Bug #400 (partial): Driver fixes for the dlloader. When using dlloader, all
        framebuffer formats except cfb and the overlay modes should work, and
        r128 and radeon need to be loaded from the ati driver (both issues to
        be fixed soon). Tested on i740, s3virge, mach64, tdfx, vesa, and vga
        drivers. elfloader users shouldn't be affected.

    Addition of console input after removal of core backend input that is not
        on screen 0 can cause a segfault. Fix by preventing reinitialization of
        detached inputs. When Xinerama is active and screen 0 is detached,
        pixmaps for XGetImage must be obtained from another screen.

        a "few" fscks having happened between testing the code and committing
        (due to other driver changes that made me not blame dirty for the
        failures I saw) for disappearance of kasync.c changes. Fixes a lot of

    ifdef'ed some IA32-only assembler statements. Presently these chipsets are
        IA32 only, anyway (Egbert Eich).
    Disabling generic VGA testing for IA64 architectures. Temporarily disabling
        support for ZX1 bus. This code is extremely invasive and is executed as
        fallback without testing for a ZX1 chipset. It brings a SGI Altrix to a
        grinding halt. (Egbert Eich).

    Separated Intel drivers from default DriDrivers to avoid building them on
        IA64 (Egbert Eich).
    Fixed wrong function prototype (Egbert Eich).
    Don't test for generic VGA on IA64 (Egbert Eich).
    Fixed a segfault when accessing a structure before verifying the pointer
        exists (Egbert Eich).
    Added a showcache option for debugging (Egbert Eich).
    Increase default video RAM size to 16MB when DRI is enabled and more than
        128MB are available (Egbert Eich). Fixed lockups during mode switch.
        Problem was introduced when attempting to copy the behavior during
        LeaveVT()/EnterVT() but but forgetting to call I810DRILeave() before
        I810DRIEnter(). The entire DRILeave()/Enter() scenario has been
        commented out as it didn't seem to be necessary (Egbert Eich).
    Fix TweakMemorySize() (tested with i855/i865) (Egbert Eich).
    increased MAX_DEVICES to 128 (Egbert Eich).
    Use OS provided PCI config space access as default method (Egbert Eich).
    Added support for Linux 2.6 proc file format.
    Fixed unaligned accesses to pieces of the VBE info block. VESA did not
        align elements to size (Egbert Eich).

        offscreen pixmap area, and set it when any rendering occurs. When

        dirtied (compared to the system memory copy).

Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@freebsd.org>
Date:   Tue Jun 29 20:37:51 2004 +0000

    Add an offscreen area scoring to improve choosing offscreen areas to kick
        out when allocation can't find a free area of the requested size. When
        offscreen pixmaps get used, the offscreen area's score is increased by
        a constant value. Every certain number of increases, all offscreen area
        scores get decreased by a fraction. When choosing a set of areas to
        remove for a new allocation, the set of areas with the smallest total
        score is chosen for removal. While this is not the smartest system, it
        prevents things like always removing the first offscreen area in memory
        (likely the most recent) to be kicked out when doing replacing.

    - Use a real pixmap when doing an UploadToScratch (For pDrawable->type ==

    Allow for multiple composite-based visuals, then add an RGB24 visual in
        addition to the ARGB32 one. This allows 'glitz' to run on top of any X
        server using mesa.
    Switch to using 32bpp for depth 24 pixmaps (even when the frame buffer is
        not depth 24).

    Fix SYNC_ALWAYS (debugging) code to use mach64WaitIdle instead of
        KdCheckSync -- the boolean used in the latter won't be set yet.
    Oops. == instead of =.
    Must sync hardware before rasterizing trapezoids in case the mask is in
        off-screen memory and has just been erased. Yes, it is silly to place
        masks in off-screen memory. That's a separate issue.

commit 94648799c82e59166155ca5abf22a9391693e6a1
Author: Keith Packard <keithp@keithp.com>
Date:   Thu May 20 02:42:20 2004 +0000

    Pin header-only pixmaps in memory.
    Off-screen reallocation could have used a stale pointer.
    Separate framebuffer mapping computation from actual frame buffer mapping.
        Now map the frame buffer from vesaEnable so that VT switch shares the
        same mapping code. This makes sure any shadow framebuffer is allocated
        again.

Date:   Mon May 17 20:18:02 2004 +0000

    Overhaul of the ATI driver:
    - Add monochrome hardware cursor support.
    - Try to auto-detect AGP support for DRI on Radeons. And fail. Detect it
        properly on R128.
    - Set up card for pseudo-DMA if possible. Convert 2D rendering code to
        prepare DMA packets only. Use generic code to decode DMA packets to
        MMIO if PDMA is unavailable. Add WIP code to support "real" DMA without
        DRM support.
    - Dispatch pending DMA commands when the server sleeps. Otherwise some
        things, such as typing in an xterm, wouldn't show up for a time.
    - Fix Radeon Composite acceleration in many ways, and add Rage 128
        Composite acceleration. Disable them both due to still-not-understood
        issues they have. They fail with In, Out, AtopReverse, and Xor, and
        text rendering is strange.
    - Add textured XV support for R100 and Rage 128. No brightness/sat
        controls, but it does support multiple ports, and cooperates with
        Composite.
    - Add WIP code for hostdata uploads.
    - Many cleanups and fixes.

        support to ensure that the destination is in framebuffer.

    Add new CheckComposite hook. This allows a driver to avoid the migration of
        pixmaps for a Composite operation if the operation can't be supported.
        This hook is optional.

    Fix problems in render fb implementation found by rendercheck:
    - fbCombineSaturate was pointed at fbCombineDisjointOver, instead of
        fbCombineDisjointOverReverse as it should. Instead, point
        fbCombineDisjointOverReverse at fbCombineSaturate (which is likely to
        be faster).
    - fix previously-unused fbCombineSaturate implementation.
    - fbCombineMaskAlphaC was just a copy of fbCombineMaskValueC. Make it do
        what it's supposed to (return a cs.alpha).
    - fbCombineAtopC didn't invert the source alpha value.
    - fix copy'n'paste errors in fbCombine(Dis/Con)jointGeneralC, also source
        alpha wasn't treated in a component fashion.
    - fbCompositeSrc_8888* didn't handle when the source lacks an alpha
        channel. Rather than adding that and possilby slowing down the (normal)
        alpha case, don't let x8r8g8b8/x8b8g8r8 Pictures be used in
        fbCompositeSrc_8888* because Over with one of these is just Src.

    small fixes, but still can't get this driver woking again

commit b526276faa765df893197e04370a915ed73947dc
Author: Brent Cook <busterbcook@yahoo.com>
Date:   Mon Apr 5 02:52:35 2004 +0000

    removed hardcoded vesa references so we can operate with any backend. fbdev
        works for initializing the screen, but input fails shortly after.

commit 920e6ff81baeec16465f81bacbcff711ce82e149
Author: Brent Cook <busterbcook@yahoo.com>
Date:   Sun Apr 4 07:30:07 2004 +0000

    Begin separating VESA calls into a more generic backend wrapper like the
        ati driver, cascading between VESA and FBDEV. We only have init
        functions done so far; need to add all of the others. Fixed some
        compiler warnings. Whitespace and formatting cleanups (using 4 spaces,
        no tabs)

commit 530371ceaf7f593badf38bbc2d2e50f6a920d24f

    added touchscreen support, detect all known PCI chips in the Neomagic line.
        We'll not bother with ISA for now.

Date:   Sat Apr 3 22:22:48 2004 +0000

        parts, with some hardware acceleration enabled for the cursor on the
        NM2300.

Author: Egbert Eich <eich@suse.de>
Date:   Tue Mar 30 14:23:15 2004 +0000

    36. Conversion: __AMD64__ > __amd64__ (Egbert Eich).
    35. Fixed stretching option and centering in C&T driver (Egbert Eich).
    34. Added support for memory size tweaking in BIOS for i845 (Egbert Eich,
        thanks to Christian Ziez)
    33. Removed video playback dependency on Accel in NSC drivers (Egbert
    3Eich).
    32. Fix HW cursor state on Savage driver when entering VT as some BIOSes
        seem to enable it unconditionally (Egbert Eich).
    31. Fixed Emulate3Button message to distinguish between 'hard' (ie.
        configured) and 'soft' (ie. automatic emulation that is disabled as
        soon as the middle button is pressed) (Egbert Eich).
    30. Free XrmDB in XCloseDisplay() only when implicitely allocated by
        XGetDefaults(). If Client allocates it itself it should free it also.
        Trying to free it for the client may result in segfault if the client
        has already freed it (Egbert Eich).

    Twenty link errors for Xizzle now - count 'em. 20.
    Get rid of all references to SCO.
    Change SDK include dir to $(includedir)/xizzle. Add SDK libs where
        necessary.
    Reformat to be nicer and easier to shuffle around; also, fix lib ordering
        so we get so much closer to the elusive final link. Shuffle
        common/xf86Init.c into libxizzle.a.
    Fix a couple of early snafus - s/BUILDXI/XINPUT/, et al; make the SDK stuff
        conditional as needed; fix the SBus includes.
    Name library os-support/libxizzleos.a, not os-support/foo/libxizzlefoo.a.
        Clean up ARCH_SOURCES so it's always initialised to something.
    Move linked libraries to _LIBADD, which somehow escaped my attention. Make
        inclusion of drm/libxizzlelinuxdrm.a dependent on DRI.
    s/VERSION/VBE_VERSION/;
    Axe this redundant dir.
    All Xizzle-specific: axe hw/xizzle/Xi, shuffle link order, fix list of
        required modules to be vaguely sane, add some pertinent libs/incs.

        FatalError. These direct calls to exit(1) made it impossible to do
        anything ddx-specific in these cases; note that most of these calls
        occur during argument processing.

    bug #230 Revert to Xinerama 1.1 In order to make a "quick" release it has
        been decided that the priority is to preserve the server's internal
        API/ABI so that third-party drivers that depend on symbols like
        noPanoramiXExtension, etc., would not need to be recompiled. Toobad gcc
        on Linux doesn't support ELF's weak symbols as that would have been a
        reasonable solution for preserving the ABI. N.B.: While symbols, i.e.
        functions and variables revert to the old name, I did not revert build
        names, i.e. -DXINERAMA, to the old -DPANORAMIX. There was no need, and
        it's just a build issue that has no impact on the binary output of the
        build.

    More NULL checks. These ones are more useful than the last (which just made
        debugging a bunch of problems easier), since you can implement less in
        the basic simplest case driver now (not that i'm lazy, mind :-p)

    Disable GLX visuals code on !GLXEXT, and remove a useless prototype.

Author: Eric Anholt <anholt@freebsd.org>
Date:   Sun Jan 25 01:30:33 2004 +0000

    - Add glx visuals code based on XFree86's Radeon driver.
    - Reserve areas for back/depth/span when USING_DRI && GLXEXT. This would be
        better in a TransitionTo3d, but we'd need to work with the offscreen
        memory manager for that.
    - Misc. fixes to ati_dri.c for DRI+GLX. Needs more work still.

    Forced commit: Previous commit included the removal of the 8192 scanline
        limit on offscreen memory in the fbdev case. I remember daenzer (who
        originally put that code in) saying he wasn't sure of it, and there
        doesn't seem to be any reason for that limit given how acceleration is
        done.

    - Add a new UploadToScratch kaa hook for putting the data for a single
        pixmap into temporary offscreen storage. Subsequent UploadToScratch may
        clobber the data of previous ones. This allows hardware acceleration of
        composite operations on glyphs.
    - Add a new UploadToScreen kaa hook for doing the actual moving of data to
        framebuffer. This would allow us to do things like hostdata blits or
        memcpy to agp and then blit.
    - Add an UploadToScreen on ATI which is just memcpy, but which will be
        replaced with a hostdata blit soon.
    - Add UploadToScratch on ATI and reserve 64k of scratch space. This
        provided a 3x speedup of rgb24text on my Radeon.

    Speed things up slightly by removing Z values from emitted vertices and by
        emitting as a tri fan rather than a tri list. A rect list would save an
        additional vertex (out of 4) per rectangle, but there's no measurable
        speed difference and the tri fan may be useful when transforms come
        into play.

    - Add more Composite operations, including Saturate, to Radeon Composite
        accel. I don't 100% trust that the math works for Saturate, but I can't
        tell from existing information.
    - Fix texture pitch fallback checks.
    - Fallback when src or mask have transforms.
    - Disable Radeon Composite accel until the offset thing is fixed.
    - Set offscreenPitch to 64 on Radeon thanks to new information and a kaa
        fix. Fixes acceleration at width!=1024.

    Split the various attempts at accelerating Composite into separate
        functions. Along with making things more readable, it fixes a problem
        where the coordinates would get messed up if acceleration failed due to
        things like pixmaps being in the wrong locations.

    - Add new Composite hook for kdrive drivers, which only ensures that the
        pixmaps are offscreen and don't have alpha maps. It is the last case
        checked before going to software fallback
    - Use the new Composite hook in the ati driver to implement acceleration of
        most Composites that get done in an xcompmgr environment on r100 series
        cards. It is only available when using the DRM. There are still some
        corruption issues, but the DRI is still non-default and I need to get
        this into version control.

    Merge dri-0-1-branch to trunk. Notable changes:
    - Add libdrm and libdri. Portions of the DRI extension are stubbed out.
    - Use the DRM in the ATI driver when available. This provides a minor
        performance improvement in x11perf, and opens the possibility of using
        the 3d hardware for acceleration in the future.
    - Implement solid fill acceleration for Composite in KAA.
    - Implement Blend hook for Composite and use it on r128.
    - Fix a bug of mine that resulted in overuse of offscreen memory.
    - Fix many miscellaneous bugs in ATI driver and add PCI IDs.

    First pass at "Standard" Xinerama. The sources for this came from Heather
        Lanigan's xinerama tree on Sourceforge.Net. No attempt has been made to
        handle previous, non-standard versions of the protocol. Nor has any
        attempt been made to preserve the ABI of previous versions -- that part
        will be added at a later time, and then probably only on systems that
        have nice object/linker semantics, e.g. ELF systems with weak symbols.

    - Add fbdev mode-setting backend to Xati. It and vesa are compiled in when
        available, with fbdev being used by default.
    - Use depth 16 by default when vesa backend is used.
    - Add MMIO defines for PowerPC (should be in a common location).
    Many thanks for Michel Daenzer for much of this code.

    - Fix Radeon offscreen pixmap pitch alignment.
    - Remove usleeps from idle and waitavail code, recommended by keithp.
    - Add a workaround for apparent broken acceleration with Rage 128 and
        offset alignment with 8-bit acceleration (24-hack and plain 8-bit).
    - Minor cleanup of setup code.

    - Add offscreen pixmap support to Xati.

    - Fix confusion of depth/bitsPerPixel in ati_draw.c
    - Disable acceleration with 24bpp due to apparent broken acceleration.
        Accel at 24bpp was the cause of the crashes when people tried to use
        any depth over 16. XFree86 doesn't support 24 either.
    - Disable at < 8bpp, too.
    - Add the other Rage 128 PCI IDs.
    - Remove unnecessary setting of scissor registers (only default scissor
        gets used).

    - Add PCI information (device/vendor id, bus location) to KdCardAttr to
        help with ati, and future DRM drivers.
    - Add new "ati" kdrive driver. It has ancestry in the r128 driver from
        andersca, but took a detour through being the WIP SiS 300 driver on the
        way. It supports Radeons (tested on QD VIVO and 7500) and Rage 128.
        Current limitations include that it requires depth 16 and that the
        other Rage 128 PCI IDs aren't included yet.

    Fix API to FbDots functions to make PolyPoint work with screen_x/screen_y

    Add debugging code to make sure no pictures are left pointing at freed
        pixmaps. "Can't" happen, but it did once.
    Change KdOffscreenArea structure to eliminate separate private structure,
        eliminate the ScreenPtr, change from doubly linked to singly linked

    Have the composite extension tell the damage extension about clients which
        have redirected subwindows in manual mode. Those clients are marked
        Critical and given a significant scheduling boost whenever they receive
        a damage notify event. This dramatically improves update frequency.
    If the kernel reported a large number of keys, readKernelMapping would walk
        off the end of the kdKeysym array.

    Ok, Composite extension is semi-working; when no-one asks for redirection,
        the server seems to act as before. With RedirectSubwindows (root,
        automatic), the server looks just like a regular X server. Now to go
        rewrite the (currently lame) compositing manager to get some real
        action on the screen.
    Some of the fixes here are to make valgrind quiet with various ioctls used
        by kdrive/linux.
    Also fixed a bug where fbdev initialization was out of order in fbdev.c and
        smi.c

    Use same assumptions as layergc about what layer kind is approprate for

    Add pixmap migration support to kaa. Can't quite automatically migrate
        pixmaps off-screen, but soon we will. Can kick objects out of video
        memory. Move per-screen linked list pointers to pixmap private. Wrap
        Composite in preparation for migrating pixmaps. Have kasync ignore
        drawable type so that pixmaps trigger sync Add KdOffscreenFini to
        cleanup on server reset. Switch off screen area to have only a 'save'
        function; moving objects to off screen memory is done by saving then
        freeing the area.

commit a2637ba1f6c8417a48c95c9b65542c696ba0c8c0
Author: Egbert Eich <eich@suse.de>
Date:   Mon Sep 16 18:05:35 2002 +0000

    319. Moved LdPreLib define after the vendor/OS specific config files as it
        may depend on setting done there (Egbert Eich).
    318. Several fixes for cross compile environment (Egbert Eich).
    317. Added code to allow for building of static only libraries with
    -fPIC for platforms which require it (Egbert Eich).
    316. Added '-m32' to gcc flags as default for ia32 builds when gcc version
        is >= 3.1. This allows building a 32 bit Version of X on 64bit x86-64
        (Egbert Eich).
    315. Changed direct calls of ld to 'gcc -nostdlib' for Linux (Egbert Eich).
    314. Changed calls to as to 'gcc -c -x assembler-with-cpp' for Linux
        (Egbert Eich).
    313. Added '-fno-strict-aliasing' flag to gcc version >= 3.1 (Egbert Eich).
        Strict requires that one address must not contain pointers to different
        types - a feature heavily used by X (Egbert Eich).
    312. Fixed a core dump problem in libXtt (?) (Egbert Eich).
    311. Removed '#pragma pack' from structures that contain function pointers
        in x86emu. This causes problems on gcc 3.1 for ia64 (Egbert Eich).
    310. Added defines for missing X types to saverproto.h (Egbert Eich).
    309. Fixed compiler warings generated by gcc >= 3.1 in mesa drivers (Egbert
        Eich).
    308. For platforms that allow both 32 and 64 bit libraries to be executed
        split Xlib i18n modules path into
        <libpath>/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/lib/common and
        <libpath>/X11R6/lib/X11/locale/lib64/common. 'lib64' has been defined
        to be the default path for 64bit shared libraries on these platforms
        (Egbert Eich).
    307. Fixed obvious typo in OMlib (Egbert Eich).
    306. Fixed code in cfb that didn't comply with C sequence rules. Modern C
        compilers tend to be more aggressive on code reordering (Egbert Eich).
    305. Changed arguments of NoopDDA() from VarArgs to void. Handling of
        VarArgs by gcc isn't compatible with the way it was used on certain
        platforms (Egbert Eich).
    304. Added support for 32bit pixmaps for 24bit overlay framebuffers in fb
        overlay code (Egbert Eich).
    303. Fixed kdrive to print a meaningful error message instead of just core
        dump when no matching graphics cards is found (Egbert Eich).
    302. fixed portability bug in xwd (Andreas Schwab <schwab@suse.de>)
    301. fixed X Server crash, which happended each time a proportional
        iso10646 font was loaded with xtt backend (Yong Li
        <rigel863@yahoo.com>)
    300. Added some ARM specific fixes to compiler.h (Uli Hecht).
    299. Added a virtual 'dummy' driver (Egbert Eich).
    298. Fixed core dump when certain access functions are not set in xf86Bus.c
        (Egbert Eich).
    297. Fixed problem where SIGIO could be disabled after a server reset.
    296. Added configurable list of devices the xf86Misc extension is allowed
        to change the mouse device to (Egbert Eich).
    295. Changed default mouse type to 'auto' when generating config file with
        '-configure' (Egbert Eich).
    294. Made sure keyboard modifier settings are consistent after exit from
        DGA when the xkb extension is used (Egbert Eich).
    293. Disabled keyboard processing when Xserver is suspended by power
        management. This allows effective locking of laptops when stolen
        (Egbert Eich).
    292. Added/improved options for lockfile syncing (Egbert Eich).
    291. Added support for backup copy of Xserver logfile (Egbert Eich).
    290. Fixed GetTimeInMillis() to use deltas instead of absolute time
        returend by gettimeofday(). This ensures time is monotonic in X (Egbert
        Eich).
    289. Fixed xf86Misc extension to allow modification of Expps2 mice (Egbert
        Eich).
    288. Made code in xf86MiscExt.c more readable (Egbert Eich).
    287. Fixed PCI CardBus bridge handling (Egbert Eich).
    286. Added code to reenable PCI bus mastering after coming back from a VT
        switch to radeon driver (Charl P. Botha <http://cpbotha.net/>) (Egbert
        Eich).
    285. Dito for r128 driver (M. Harris).
    284. Dito for glint and mga driver (Egbert Eich).
    283. Fixed double scan issues for low res modes in C&T driver (Egbert
        Eich).
    282. Set rgbBits to 8 for all HiQV chips in chips driver (Egbert Eich).
    281. Moved initialization of accel funtions past initialization of
        offscreen fb manager in chips driver (Egbert Eich).
    280. Fixed initialization of video in chips driver (?).
    279. Fixed HALlib problem restoring text mode on G550 (Egbert Eich).
    278. Restructured and included Matrox's Merged Framebuffer changes to mga
        driver (Egbert Eich).
    277. G450/550 clockchip programming fixes (Matrox).
    276. Fixed HW Cursor for HALlib frame granularity (Egbert Eich).
    275. Enabling 2D accel in 24-bit for neomagic 2360 and 2380 (Egbert Eich).
    274. Added support for builtin 1024x480 mode of Sony subnotebooks for
        Neomagic driver (Egbert Eich).
    273. Fixed support for lowRes (320x240) modes in neomagic driver (Egbert
        Eich).
    272. Fixed RAC function registration in S3 driver (Egbert Eich).
    271. Added some voodoo to screen initialization of S3 driver (Egbert Eich).
    270. Fixed vbe/int10 support in SMI driver. It used to core dump when BIOS
        was not usable (Egbert Eich).
    269. Separated BRIGHTNESS and and CAPTURE_BRIGNTESS video attributes in smi
        driver: CAPTURE_BRIGHTNESS refers to the capture chip (ie. Philips
        SAA7110) while BRIGHTNESS controls the video overlay of the SMI chip
        itself (Egbert Eich).
    268. Disable automatic loading of DRI when running SUN ffb as this is
        inconsistent with other drivers (Thorsten Kukuk).

    260. Fixed video support for Trident 9397 (Egbert Eich).
    265. Fixed Cursor/VT switch support for vmware driver (Egbert Eich).
    264. Fixed Blit problems in vmware driver when running KDE (Egbert Eich).
    263. Added RENDER support to vmware driver (Egbert Eich).
    262. Added C&T 69030 to extrapci.ids (Egbert Eich).
    261. Improved mouse autodetection code (Egbert Eich).
    260. Restructured int10 code so that vm86 and x86emu support can be loaded
        as modules. Implemented heuristic to try vm86 first and fall back to
        x86emu. This allows 32 bit Xservers to run on x86_64 on 64-bit kernel
        without vm86 support (Egbert Eich).
    259. Restructured elf loader: determine which section to load from
        elfheader flags (Egbert Eich).
    258. Adding RENDER Support to RAC (Egbert Eich).
    257. Using borderClip instead of borderSize region for redisplay function
        in miext/shadow code to avoid core dumps when vt switched away (Egbert
        Eich).
    256. Replacing sprintf() by snprintf() in lbxproxy to eliminate possible
        buffer overrun exploits (Egbert Eich).
    255. KP_Decimal fixes to Czech and Slovak keybards (Jan Holesovsky
        <kendy@suse.cz>) (Egbert Eich).

    38. Fix xmh's use of XtNewString() with getenv (#4694, Tim Waugh).

        of group membership (#4693, Mike Harris).
