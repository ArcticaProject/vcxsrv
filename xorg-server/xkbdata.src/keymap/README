The keymap component provides a way how to set up one pre-defined keyboard
mapping from a given set. It has been obsoleted by 'rules' component which
is simplier and more flexible. The directory is preserved for compatibility
reasons. Avoid using it if it is possible.

The keymap files are in .xkm format and useful when using xkbcomp.
