/*
    this works for fonts with glyphs <= 32 bits wide, on an
    arbitrarily deep display.  Use cfbTEGlyphBlt8 for 8 bit displays.

    This should be called only with a terminal-emulator font;
this means that the FIXED_METRICS flag is set, and that
glyphbounds == charbounds.

    in theory, this goes faster; even if it doesn't, it reduces the
flicker caused by writing a string over itself with image text (since
the background gets repainted per character instead of per string.)
this seems to be important for some converted X10 applications.

    Image text looks at the bits in the glyph and the fg and bg in the
GC.  it paints a rectangle, as defined in the protocol dcoument,
and the paints the characters.
