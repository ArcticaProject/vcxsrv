X Keyboard Extension
--------------------

The X Keyboard Extension essentially replaces the core protocol definition
of the keyboard.  The extension makes it possible to clearly and explicitly
specify most aspects of keyboard behaviour on a per-key basis and to more
closely track the logical and physical state of the keyboard.  It also
includes a number of keyboard controls designed to make keyboards more
accessible to people with physical impairments.

There are five types of components in the server database corresponding to
five xkb symbolic names (symbols, geometry, keycodes, compat, and types)
which determine the keyboard behaviour.  These five components can be
combined into a resulting keyboard mapping using the 'rules' component.

The complete specification can be found in:
  http://www.x.org/current/doc/kbproto/xkbproto.pdf

For XKB configuration information, see the 'docs/README.config' file.

For information on how to further enhance XKB configuration, see the
'docs/README.enhancing' file.

For information on how to replace an existing XKB configuration database
with XKeyboardConfig, see the 'docs/HOWTO.transition' file.
