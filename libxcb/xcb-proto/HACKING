Make patches more descriptive
=============================

By default hunk headers of a patch will look like this:

    @@ -1227,6 +1227,8 @@ authorization from the authors.

Which is not very usefull as it doesn't give a hint where the change
happened (except for the line number). To make those hunk headers more
descriptive, i.e.:

    @@ -1227,6 +1227,8 @@ <struct name="HierarchyChange">

Add these 2 lines to your .git/config file:

    [diff "xcb"]
        xfuncname = "(<\\b(xcb|enum|event|request|struct|union)\\b.*>)"

For more background on this magic have a look at src/.gitattributes and
the man page gitattributes(5) chapter "Defining a custom hunk-header".
