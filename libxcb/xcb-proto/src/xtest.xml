    <!-- There are several ways to use the FakeInput request:
            1. Simulate a keypress:
                type   = XCBKeyPress or XCBKeyRelease
                detail = keycode
            2. Simulate a button:
                type   = XCBButtonPress or XCBButtonRelease
                detail = enum XCBButton (1..5)
            3. Simulate mouse motion:
                type   = XCBMotionNotify
                detail = 0 or 1
                root = XCBNone or a root window id
                rootX,
                rootY  = position (relative if detail==1)

        Version 2.2 adds support for the XInput extension:
            4. Simulate a device keypress
            5. Simulate a device button
            6. Simulate a proximity event
            7. Simulate a device motion event
                [These are not yet supported, since we would also need to
                 send the variable-length state of the axes.]

        In each case, time is set to a delay in milliseconds.
