Release 1.2 (2008-07-17)
========================
New extensions:

New Python parser language-independent parts.

Release 1.1 (2007-11-04)
========================

Incompatible change to the XML schema: rather than special-casing the
treatment of protocol extension names, use the new extension-multiword
attribute.  Normally, XCB prefixes C extension functions with
xcb_extname_.  However, some of the existing extensions used multi-word
names, such as xcb_big_requests_ or xcb_xc_misc_. Those extensions now
use this attribute to match their existing defined API.  This allows the
XCB code generator to avoid special-casing those extension names.

Protocol updates:
* Update DAMAGE to 1.1
* Update RandR to version 1.2

Bug fixes:
* fix XSync Initialize call
* Update autogen.sh to one that does objdir != srcdir.


Release 1.0 (2006-11-23)
========================

The "Thanksgiving" release: We feel thankful to have it released.

* Fix Bug #8990: randr type fixes
* Fixed screen parameter type in several GLX requests to use CARD32 instead
  of the SCREEN structure.
* Corrected valueparam arguments to attribute lists in several requests and
  a reply.
* Estethic change for attribute parameter name
* Remove support for the <localfield> tag: nothing needs it.
* Fix Bug #8973: In UngrabKey, the 'key' field should have type KEYCODE, not
  the more general CARD8.


Release 1.0 RC3 (2006-11-02)
============================

* Add support for the Xinerama extension, version 1.1
* Protocol descriptions now document the major and minor version numbers
  of the extension version they support, through major-version and
  minor-version attributes on the xcb tag.  XML Schema updated
  accordingly.
* Minor source reorganization: Now that the extensions do not get
  installed to an extensions/ subdirectory, move them out of the
  extensions/ subdirectory in the source as well.
* Various protocol description fixes:
    * Add REPEAT enumeration to Render extension to fix bug #8535
    * Fix core xproto GrabMode enumeration (reported by Yang JianJun)
    * Fix core xproto cap style enumeration (bug #8857).


Release 1.0 RC2 (2006-10-07)
============================

* Add <import>xproto</import> explicitly to extensions that use xproto;
  this goes along with the change in the code generator for libxcb 1.0 RC2 to
  stop implicitly importing xproto.
* Change "union" to "xidunion" for XID unions like DRAWABLE and FONTABLE,
  so that the code generator can more easily declare these XID unions as
  integer typedefs rather than unions.
* Replace structures attempting to provide C type safety with CARD32 typedefs
* render.xml no longer describes the CompositeGlyphs* requests as taking lists
  of complicated unions of structures of lists: it says instead that they take
  a LISTofBYTE. The caller is responsible for constructing an appropriate
  sequence of glyph elements. Previously, the requests could not actually be
  used because XCB did not correctly compute the length of the provided data.


Release 1.0 RC1 (2006-09-25)
============================

The Great XCB Renaming
----------------------

* Rename shape_op and shape_kind to drop the "shape_" prefix, since
  otherwise these types end up as xcb_shape_shape_{op,kind}_t.
* Remove leading underscores from enums in the GLX protocol description,
  previously needed to ensure a word separator, but now redundant.
* The XML-XCB protocol descriptions have moved to /usr/share/xcb, with
  extension descriptions no longer relegated to an extensions/ subdirectory.

GIT Repository split
--------------------

Previously, several XCB-related projects all existed under the umbrella
of a single monolithic GIT repository with per-project subdirectories.
We have split this repository into individual per-project repositories.

Josh Triplett and Jamey Sharp wrote a tool called git-split to
accomplish this repository split. git-split reconstructs the history of
a sub-project previously stored in a subdirectory of a larger
repository. It constructs new commit objects based on the existing tree
objects for the subtree in each commit, and discards commits which do
not affect the history of the sub-project, as well as merges made
unnecessary due to these discarded commits.

We would like to acknowledge the work of the gobby team in creating a
collaborative editor which greatly aided the development of git-split
(as well as these release notes).
