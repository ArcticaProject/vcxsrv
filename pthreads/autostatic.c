 * http://www.codeguru.com/cpp/misc/misc/threadsprocesses/article.php/c6945/

 *
 * Compatibility with MSVC8 was cribbed from Boost:
 *
 * http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/trunk/libs/thread/src/win32/tss_pe.cpp
 *
 * In addition to that, because we are in a static library, and the linker
 * can't tell that the constructor/destructor functions are actually
 * needed, we need a way to prevent the linker from optimizing away this
 * module. The pthread_win32_autostatic_anchor() hack below (and in
 * implement.h) does the job in a portable manner.
