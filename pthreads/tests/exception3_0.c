 * Test Synopsis: Test running of user supplied terminate() function.
 *
 * Test Method (Validation or Falsification):
 * -
 *
 * Requirements Tested:
 * -
 *
 * Features Tested:
 * -
 *
 * Cases Tested:
 * -
 *
 * Description:
 * -
 *
 * Environment:
 * -
 *
 * Input:
 * - None.
 *
 * Output:
 * - File name, Line number, and failed expression on failure.
 * - No output on success.
 *
 * Assumptions:
 * - have working pthread_create, pthread_self, pthread_mutex_lock/unlock
 *   pthread_testcancel, pthread_cancel
 *
 * Pass Criteria:
 * - Process returns zero exit status.
 *
 * Fail Criteria:
 * - Process returns non-zero exit status.

   * Notes from the MSVC++ manual:
   *       1) A term_func() should call exit(), otherwise
   *          abort() will be called on return to the caller.
   *          abort() raises SIGABRT. The default signal handler
   *          for all signals terminates the calling program with
   *          exit code 3.
   *       2) A term_func() must not throw an exception. Dev: Therefore
   *          term_func() should not call pthread_exit() if an
   *          exception-using version of pthreads-win32 library
   *          is being used (i.e. either pthreadVCE or pthreadVSE).
