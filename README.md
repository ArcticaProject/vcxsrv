VcXsrv Windows X Server (X2Go/Arctica Builds)

This used to be the repos providing the code for the version of VcXrv that got shipped
with the Windows client of x2go (https://www.x2go.org). Starting with version 4.1.2.0
of the client (released 2018-06-25) VcXsrv's (then current) upstream version 1.20.0.0
is shipped. So this repo is no longer updated. Bug reports regarding the X server should
be opened at the upstream VcXsrv site: https://sourceforge.net/projects/vcxsrv/
