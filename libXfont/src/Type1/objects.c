:h3.The "pointer" Macro - Define a Generic Pointer
 
Sadly, many compilers will give a warning message when a pointer to
one structure is assigned to a pointer to another.  We've even seen
some that give severe errors (when the wrong pointer type is used as
an initializer or returned from a function).  TYPE1IMAGER has routines
like Dup and Allocate that are perfectly willing to duplicate or
allocate any of a number of different types of structures.  How to
declare them in a truely portable way?
 
Well, there is no single good answer that I've found.  You can always
beg the question and "cast" everything.  I find this distracting and the
resulting code ugly.  On the other hand, we have found at least one
compiler that will accept "void *" as a generic pointer that can
assigned to any other pointer type without error or warning (apparently
this is also the ANSI standard).  So, we define "void *" to be a generic
pointer.  (You might have to change this for your compiler; the "ifndef"
allows the change to be made on the command line if you want.)

declared :hp2/static/.  One of the compilers I used had a bug when
static functions were passed as addresses.  Thus, some functions
which are logically "static" are not so declared.

:h3.Flag Byte Definitions
 
Many programmers define flag bits as a mask (for example, 0x04), and
test, set, and reset them as follows:
 
&code.
        if ((flag & PERMANENT) != 0)
 
        flag |= PERMANENT;
        flag &= &inv.PERMANENT;
:exmp.
 
I favor a style where the 'if' statement can ask a question:
 
&code.
        if (ISPERMANENT(flag))
 
        flag |= ISPERMANENT(ON);
        flag &= &inv.ISPERMANENT(ON);
 
:exmp.
This said, we now define two bit settings of the flag byte of the
object.  "ISPERMANENT" will be set by the user, when he calls
Permanent().  "ISIMMORTAL" will be used for compiled-in objects
that we don't want the user to ever destroy.
*/
/*SHARED LINE(S) ORIGINATED HERE*/
/*
Flag bit definitions that apply to all objects are assigned
starting with the least significant (0x01) bit.  Flag bit definitions
specific to a certain object type are assigned starting with the
most significant (0x80) bit.  We hope they never meet.

:h3 id=preserve.PRESERVE() Macro
 
Occasionally an TYPE1IMAGER operator is implemented by calling other
TYPE1IMAGER operators.  For example, Arc2() calls Conic().  When we
call more than one operator as a subroutine, we have to be careful
of temporary objects.  A temporary object will be consumed by the
subroutine operator and then is no longer available for the caller.
This can be prevented simply by bumping a temporary object's reference
count.

:h3.LONGCOPY() - Macro to Copy "long" Aligned Data
 
Copying arbitrary bytes in C is a bit of a problem.  "strcpy" can't be
used, because 0 bytes are special-cased.  Most environments have a
routine "memcopy" or "bcopy" or "bytecopy" that copies memory containing
zero bytes.  Sadly, there is no standard on the name of such a routine,
which makes it impossible to write truely portable code to use it.
 
It turns out that TYPE1IMAGER, when it wants to copy data, frequently
knows that both the source and destination are aligned on "long"
boundaries.  This allows us to copy by using "long *" pointers.  This
is usually very efficient on almost all processors.  Frequently, it
is more efficient than using general-purpose assembly language routines.
So, we define a macro to do this in a portable way.  "dest" and "source"
must be long-aligned, and "bytes" must be a multiple of "sizeof(long)":

:h3.Allocate() - Allocating a Memory Block
 
Allocate returns a pointer to memory object that is a copy of
the template passed (if any).  In addition, extra bytes may be
allocated contiguously with the object.  (This may be useful for
variable size objects such as edge lists.  See :hdref refid=regions..)
 
Allocate() always returns a non-immortal object, even if the template is
immortal.  Therefore a non-NULL template must have a "flag" byte.
 
If the template is NULL, then 'size' bytes are cleared to all NULLs.
 
If the template is non-NULL, a new object is allocated in memory.
It therefore seems logical that its reference count field should be
set to 1. So, a nun-NULL template must also have a "references" field.

:h2.Generally Useful Macros
 
:h3.FOLLOWING() - Macro to Point to the Data Following a Structure
 
There are several places in TYPE1IMAGER where we will allocate variable
data that belongs to a structure immediately after that structure.
This is a performance technique, because it reduces the number of
trips we have to take through xiMalloc() and xiFree().  It turns out C has
a very convenient way to point past a structure--if 'p' is a pointer
to a structure, 'p+1' is a pointer to the data after it.  This
behavior of C is somewhat startling and somewhat hard to follow, if
you are not used to it, so we define a macro to point to the data
following a structure:
*/
/*SHARED LINE(S) ORIGINATED HERE*/
/*
:h3.TYPECHECK() - Verify the Type of an Argument
 
This macro tests the type of an argument.  If the test fails, it consumes
any other arguments as necessary and causes the imbedding routine to
return the value 'whenBAD'.
 
Note that the consumeables list should be an argument list itself, for
example (0) or (2,A,B).  See :hdref refid=consume. below.
*/
 
/*SHARED LINE(S) ORIGINATED HERE*/
/*
:h3.ARGCHECK() - Perform an Arbitrary Check on an Argument
 
This macro is a generalization of TYPECHECK to take an arbitrary
predicate.  If the error occurs (i.e., the predicate is true), the
arbitrary message 'msg' is returned.
*/
 
/*SHARED LINE(S) ORIGINATED HERE*/
/*
:h3.TYPENULLCHECK() - Extension of TYPECHECK() for NULL arguments
 
Many routines allow NULLs to be passed as arguments.  'whenBAD' will
be returned in this case, too.
*/
 
/*SHARED LINE(S) ORIGINATED HERE*/
/*
:h3.MAKECONSUME() - Create a "Consume"-type Macro
 
Consuming an object means destroying it if it is not permanent.  This
logic is so common to all the routines, that it is immortalized in this
macro.  For example, ConsumePath(p) can be simply defined as
MAKECONSUME(p,KillPath(p)).  In effect, this macro operates on a
meta-level.
:i1/consuming objects/
*/
 
/*SHARED LINE(S) ORIGINATED HERE*/
 
/*
:h3.MAKEUNIQUE() - Create a "Unique"-type Macro
 
Many routines are written to modify their arguments in place.  Thus,
they want to insure that they duplicate an object if it is permanent.
This is called making an object "unique".  For example, UniquePath(p)
can be simply defined as MAKEUNIQUE(p,DupPath(p)).
:i1/unique objects/
*/
 
/*SHARED LINE(S) ORIGINATED HERE*/
 
/*
An object is unique (and directly alterable) if there is only one
reference to it, and it is not permanent (in which case we increment
the reference count, so we don't have to check the permanent bit).
3-26-91 PNM
 
Note the rules for making a unique object:
&drawing.
   IF  (obj->references = 1)    return(obj);
   ELSE (references > 1)
       IF (ISPERMANENT(obj->flag))    return(Dupxxx(obj));
       ELSE (nonunique, temporary object!)
           obj->references--; return(Dupxxx(obj));
&edrawing.
If we must make a Copy of a nonunique, temporary object, we decrement
reference count of the original object!
*/
 
/*
:h3.Unique() - Make a Unique Object
 
Here is a generic 'Unique' function if the object type is not known.
Why didn't we build it with the MAKEUNIQUE macro, you ask?  Well, we
used to, but there is at least one damn compiler in the world that
raises errors if the types of an "(a) ? b : c" expression do not match.
Also, when we changed Dup() to retain the permanent/temporary flag, we
wanted to make sure "Unique" always returned a temporary object.
 
Note that we cannot use Dup() to create a copy of the object in question,
because Dup() may simply bump the reference count, and not return a
unique copy to us. That is why we use t1_Copy().
 
The purpose of this function is to make sure we have a copy of an object
that we can safely alter:
:ol.
:li.If we have a unique, temporary object, we simply return the argument.
:li.If we have a nonunique, temporary object, we have to make a new copy
of it, and decrement the reference count of the original object, to reflect
the fact that we traded temporary handles.
:li.If we have a permanent object, we make a temporary copy of it, but
we do not decrement the reference count of the original permanent object,
because permanent objects, by definition, are persistent. 3-2-6-91 PNM

'extern'.  This is logical, but is somewhat awkward to implement with
C include files.  We solve the problem by temporarily making the name
'extern' a null name if GLOBALS is defined.  (GLOBALS is only defined
in this OBJECTS module.)  Since 'externs' can't be initialized, we
have to handle that with #defines too.
