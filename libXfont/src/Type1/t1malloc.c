:h3.Define NULL
 
In the beginning, C compilers made no assumptions about NULL.  It was
even theoretically possible that NULL would not be 0.  ANSI has tied
this down a bit.  The following definition seems to be the most
popular (in terms of reducing compiler complaints), however, if your
compiler is unhappy about it, you can redefine it on the command line:

Of course, NULL is important because xiMalloc() is defined to return

:h2.Data Structures Used to Manage Free Memory
 
:h3.The "freeblock" Structure
 
The list of available memory blocks is a doubly-linked list.  Each
block begins with the following structure:
*/
 
struct freeblock {
        long size;                      /* number of 'longs' in block,
                                           including this header */
        struct freeblock *fore;        /* forward in doubly-linked list */
        struct freeblock *back;        /* backward in doubly-linked list */
} ;
/*
In addition, each free block has a TRAILER that is simply the 'size'
repeated.  Thus 'size' is found at the beginning of the block and at the
end of the block (size-1 longs away).  'size' includes both the header
and the trailer.
 
When a block is allocated, its 'size' is turned negative (both at the
beginning and at the end).  Thus, checking whether two blocks may be
combined is very simple.  We merely examine both neighboring blocks'
size to see if they are positive (and hence available for combination).
 
The memory address returned to the user is therefore one "long" below the
size, and one extra "long" is added to the end of the block (beyond what
the user requested) to store the trailing size.
 
:h3."firstfree" and "lastfree", the Anchors to the Free List
 
"firstfree" points to the first available free block; "lastfree" points
to the end of the chain of available blocks.  These are linked together
by initialization code; see :hdref refid=addmem..

/*
:h3."firstcombined" and "uncombined", Keeping Track of Uncombined Blocks
 
This module is designed to make the combining of adjacent free memory
blocks be very fast.  Nonetheless, combining blocks is naturally the
most expensive part of any memory system.  In an X system,
it is worthwhile to defer the combination for a while, because
frequently we will end up asking for a block of exactly the same
size that we recently returned and we can save ourselves some work.
 
"MAXUNCOMBINED" is the maximum number of uncombined blocks that we will
allow at any time:

/*
:h3.MINEXCESS - Amount of "Excess" We Would be Willing to Ignore
 
When we search the free list to find memory for a user request, we
frequently find an area that is bigger than what the user has asked for.
Normally we put the remaining words (the excess) back on the free list.
However, if the area is just slightly bigger than what the user needs,
it is counter-productive to do this, as the small amount recovered tends
to hurt by increasing memory fragmentation rather than help by providing
more available memory.  "MINEXCESS" is the number of words that must be
recovered before we would bother to put the excess back on the free
list.  If there is not enough excess, we just give the user more than he
asked for.
