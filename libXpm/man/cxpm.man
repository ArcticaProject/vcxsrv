.SH NAME
cxpm \- Check an XPM (X PixMap) file, versions XPM 1, 2, or 3.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcxpm\fR
[\|\fIfilename\fP\|]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \fBcxpm\fP program can be used to check the format of any XPM (version 1, 2,
or 3) file. On error, unlike \fBsxpm\fR, \fBcxpm\fR prints out an error message
indicating where the parser choked. This should help finding out what's wrong
with an XPM file but do not expect too much from it though. This is not even
close from being some kind of lint program for XPM. First, it stops at the
first error it encounters - so several fix and retry cycles may be necessary to
get your file to parse successfully. Second, \fBcxpm\fP only cares about
the format. If, for instance, your pixmap uses too many colors for your system
you still may experience difficulties displaying it. Be warned.
.PP
When no \fIfilename\fP is given \fBcxpm\fR reads from the standard input.
