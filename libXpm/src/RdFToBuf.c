    /* VMS often stores text files in a variable-length record format,
       where there are two bytes of size followed by the record.  fread
       converts this so it looks like a record followed by a newline.
       Unfortunately, the size reported by fstat() (and fseek/ftell)
       counts the two bytes for the record terminator, while fread()
       counts only one.  So, fread() sees fewer bytes in the file (size
       minus # of records) and thus when asked to read the amount
       returned by stat(), it fails.
       The best solution, suggested by DEC, seems to consider the length
       returned from fstat() as an upper bound and call fread() with
       a record length of 1. Then don't check the return value.
       We'll check for 0 for gross error that's all.
