			Xft
		X FreeType library
		  Version 2.3.0
		    2012-03-07

Xft version 2.1 was the first stand alone release of Xft, a library that
connects X applications with the FreeType font rasterization library. Xft
uses fontconfig to locate fonts so it has no configuration files.

Version 2.3.2

Build fix for freetype 2.5.1, man page fix for XftDrawString8 & XftDrawRect.

Version 2.3.1

Fix regression that broke bold fonts in 2.3.0, remove dead code.

Version 2.3.0

Subpixel LCD text rendering improvements

Dropped support for versions of freetype2, fontconfig & libXrender that
pre-dated pkgconfig support.

Raised minimum required versions to freetype2 2.1.6 & fontconfig 2.5.92.


Version 2.2.0

Dropped xft-config, now that pkg-config is well established.

Version 2.1.14

Added fake bold support (#1579, Novell #38202/223682).

Version 2.1.13

Fix hashing in 64-bit versions.  Register objects with freetype.
Fix XftDrawRect when Render not supported.

Version 2.1.12

Fix exporting of XftNameUnparse function.

Version 2.1.9

Stop exporting unnecessary symbols.

Version 2.1.7

Change FC_CHARCELL and FC_MONO interpretation.  FC_MONO no longer clips
glyphs to charcell, you must specify FC_CHARCELL for that.

Add support for FT_GlyphSlot_Embolden where it exists (which it usually
doesn't).

Avoid crashing when using FT_Face objects.

Version 2.1.6

Deal with broken FreeType 2.1.7 BDF/PCF loaders by trying both y_ppem/x_ppem
and width/height values.

Version 2.1.5

Left some #warnings from testing in the 2.1.4 release.  Spin again.

Version 2.1.4

Work with older versions of Fontconfig by using various pattern elements
only when defined.

Version 2.1.3

Change Freetype includes to new syntax.

Search for nearest bitmap for bitmap-only fonts.

Support fontconfig 2.2 release which doesn't include FC_HINT_STYLE.
