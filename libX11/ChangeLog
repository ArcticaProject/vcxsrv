    Add generic event cookie handling to libX11.
    
    Generic events require more bytes than Xlib provides in the standard XEvent.
    Memory allocated by the extension and stored as pointers inside the event is
    prone to leak by simple 'while (1) { XNextEvent(...); }' loops.
    
    This patch adds cookie handling for generic events. Extensions may register
    a cookie handler in addition to the normal event vectors. If an extension
    has registered a cookie handler, _all_ generic events for this extensions
    must be handled through cookies. Otherwise, the default event handler is
    used.
    
    The cookie handler must return an XGenericEventCookie with a pointer to the
    data.The rest of the event (type, serialNumber, etc.) are to be filled as
    normal. When a client retrieves such a cookie event, the data is stored in
    an internal queue (the 'cookiejar'). This data is freed on the next call to
    XNextEvent().
    
    New extension interfaces:
        XESetWireToEventCookie(display, extension_number, cookie_handler)
    
    Where cookie_handler must set cookie->data. The data pointer is of arbitray
    size and type but must be a single memory block. This memory block
    represents the actual extension's event.
    
    New client interfaces:
        XGetEventData(display, *cookie);
        XFreeEventData(display, *cookie);
    
    If the client needs the actual event data, it must call XGetEventData() with
    the cookie. This returns the data pointer (and removes it from the cookie
    jar) and the client is then responsible for freeing the event with
    XFreeEventData(). It is safe to call either function with a non-cookie
    event. Events unclaimed or not handled by the XGetEventData() are cleaned up
    automatically.
    
    Example client code:
        XEvent event;
        XGenericEventCookie *cookie = &ev;
    
        XNextEvent(display, &event);
        if (XGetEventData(display, cookie)) {
            XIEvent *xievent = cookie->data;
            ...
        } else if (cookie->type == GenericEvent) {
            /* handle generic event */
        } else {
            /* handle extension/core event */
        }
        XFreeEventData(display, cookie);
    
    Cookies are not multi-threading safe. Clients that use XGetEventData() must
    lock between XNextEvent and XGetEventData to avoid other threads freeing
    cookies.

    There were also some combining_ keysyms as targets.  As those

    Thai XIM not retrieve MB surrounding on UTF-8 LC
    
    On th_TH.UTF-8 locale, Thai XIM rejects all combining characters for GTK+ apps
    that use X Input Method.
    
    This is because GTK+ imxim immodule passes surrounding text in locale encoding,
    which is UTF-8 for UTF-8 locales. But current Thai XIM in Xlib assumes the
    multi-byte StringConversionText response for the StringConversionCallback to
    always be TIS-620, by retrieving a single byte and using it as-is.
    
    If the Thai XIM tries to convert the multi-byte text based on locale codeset
    before using it, it will work again.

    Thai XIM not filters when NumLock or CapsLock is on
    
    The Thai XIM component in libx11 activated on 'th*' locales normally filters
    input sequence according to orthographic rules. However, when NumLock/CapsLock
    is on, this stops working. All sequences are passed through.
    
    This is caused by missing masks in _XimThaiFilter(), which normally screens out
    certain special keys from entering orthographic rules. Unfortunately, this
    included events with NumLock/CapsLock on. Negating the masks from the check
    allows the events to be tested by the rules.

    CharSet-to-CompoundText Conversion Failed for Thai Locales
    
    SCIM fails to commit Thai input characters on Thai locales, because it commits
    string in compound text form, which was converted via
    XwcTextListToTextProperty(). But the XLC_LOCALE for th_TH and th_TH.UTF-8
    declares cs1's ct_encoding as TIS620-0:GR, which was commented out in
    src/xlibi18n/lcCT.c default_ct_data, in favor of ISO8859-11 ESC sequence.
    So, declaring cs1 as ISO8859-11:GR instead makes it work.
    
    Besides, for th_TH.UTF-8, adding cs2 class with ISO10646-1 encoding also adds
    support for UTF-8 input.
    
    And, along discussion in the bug, a similar problem was found for fontset, too,
    by causing delays on X apps startups on systems without tis620-0 fonts. This
    is normally the case, as mkfontdir and mkfontscale generate iso8859-11 entries
    by default for Thai X fonts. So, Thai fontset charset is also patched.

    This reverts commit 892b401d5acc055803a20e349ede0d64490f2230.
    
    As Julien Cristau correctly points out, I misread the Compose file grammar
    in modules/im/ximcp/imLcPrs.c, and those are keysyms, not comments, and
    the keysym is named XK_masculine in keysymdef.h.   This change is thus a
    bug in the Solaris compose tables to be fixed, not an improvement to bring
    upstream.

    flags member of Display structure needs to be marked volatile
    
    Since the Xlib multithreaded code checks the flags variable in _XFlushInt
    to see if the other threads are done yet, it has to be marked volatile so
    the compiler doesn't optimize out re-loading it on each trip through the
    while loop and end up in an impossible-to-exit infinite loop of CPU chewing.

    WORD64 compile fix. This bug catched on a overview of the code.
    
    The code is wrong since the first git revision, so it seens that it has
    not been compiled with WORD64 for quite some time, there is also another
    interesting code in xkb/XKBRdBuf.c:
      <hash>ifdef WORD64
      _XkbWriteCopyData32 Not Implemented Yet for sizeof(int)==8
      <hash>endif
    and possibly there are other similar problems.

    Author is Peter Breitenlohner <peb@mppmu.mpg.de>
    Bug #17946, attachment #19441
    
    This patch avoids the two gcc warnings
    	../../../../libX11-1.1.5/modules/im/ximcp/imRm.c:413: warning: assignment discards qualifiers from pointer target type
    	../../../../libX11-1.1.5/modules/im/ximcp/imRm.c:450: warning: assignment discards qualifiers from pointer target type
    
    Note, that this as a rather crude fix of the problem (and it is really a
    shame to cast name_table to non-const).
    
    The right solution would be to declare XIMValuesList.supported_values
    (in include/X11/Xlib.h) as 'const char **' (or '_Xconst char **').
    This will, however, require extensive modifications in various places.

    Support multiple independent internal sync handlers
    
    Xlib has several independent tasks that need to be performed with the
    display unlocked. It does this by replacing the existing sync handler with
    one of a variety of internal sync handlers. However, if multiple internal
    sync handlers need to run, then the last one registering wins and
    previously registered internal sync handlers are never invoked. This
    manifested as a bug with DRI applications on Xlib/XCB as that requires
    both an XID handler after every XID allocation, and the periodic sequence
    number handler. The XID handler would win, and the sequence number handler
    would never be invoked.
    
    Fix this by unifying the internal sync handler mechanism into a single
    function that calls all of the known internal sync handlers. They all need
    to deal with being called when not strictly necessary now.

    Permit only one Xlib thread to block waiting for events
    
    As Xlib queues events internally, we must prevent multiple Xlib threads from
    entering XCB to wait for an event in case the queued event is to be
    delivered to the thread which didn't manage to read it. In other words, let
    only one Xlib thread into xcb_wait_for_event at a time.

    Fix XAllocID race: hold the user display lock until we have a new XID.
    
    Xlib built --without-xcb is also vulnerable to this race, and a similar
    fix might work there too.
    
    Also, use an XID that's truly invalid while waiting for the next XID to be
    requested.

    Use XCB's new socket handoff mechanism rather than the old XCB Xlib lock.
    
    Previously, Xlib/XCB used XCB's Xlib lock to prevent XCB from sending
    requests between calls to Xlib's LockDisplay and UnlockDisplay macros.
    Xlib/XCB then sent all of its requests using XCB's xcb_send_request, and
    had to flush its requests when unlocking the display.
    
    XCB 1.2 adds a new socket handoff mechanism, xcb_take_socket.  Replace
    much of the existing Xlib/XCB implementation with the use of
    xcb_take_socket to take ownership of the write side of the X connection
    socket, and a return_socket callback which writes any outstanding requests
    with xcb_writev.  This approach allows Xlib/XCB to use the same buffering
    as traditional Xlib did.  In particular, programs which use Xlib/XCB and
    never make XCB calls will never need to hand the socket back to XCB, and
    vice versa.
    
    This allows us to discard large quantities of synchronization code from
    Xlib/XCB, together with the synchronization bugs present in that code.
    Several test cases which previously failed now work perfectly, including
    multi-threaded ico.  In addition, the infamous locking correctness
    assertions, triggered when double-locking or when unlocking without a
    previous lock, no longer exist, because Xlib/XCB no longer has any reason
    to care more about application locking than traditional Xlib does.
    
    Furthermore, the handoff approach provides great improvements to
    performance.  Results from x11perf's XNoOp test, which represented the
    worst case for the lock-based Xlib/XCB:
    
    Traditional Xlib:       average 19100000/sec
    Lock-based Xlib/XCB:    average  3350000/sec
    Handoff-based Xlib/XCB: average 17400000/sec
    
    Thus, for no-ops, the handoff mechanism provides more than a 4x speedup to
    Xlib/XCB, bringing Xlib/XCB within 9% of traditional Xlib no-op
    performance.  Of course, real-world workloads do not use no-op, so your
    mileage may vary.  In particular, since no-ops represent the worst case,
    we expect real workloads to more closely match the performance of
    traditional Xlib.
    
    While removing synchronization code, we changed _XReply to not drop any
    locks when calling xcb_wait_for_reply; previously, we had to carefully
    avoid a deadlock between the Display lock and the XCB Xlib lock. Holding
    the locks reduces implementation complexity and should not impact
    applications.

    Increase size of working arrays in the makekeys utility program.
    
    Makekeys is used to create an optimal hash of the keysyms defined
    in x11proto’s keysymdef.h.
    
    The recent addition of new keysyms there has triggered a bug in
    makekeys where it tries to use a zero on the rhs of the % (mod)
    operator (resulting in a divide by zero error) whenever it fails
    to find a solution within its constraints.
    
    Increasing the size of the arrays allows it to find a solution for
    the current set of keysyms.
    
    Makekeys is only run durring the build process, so this has no impact
    on users of libX11, only on the amount of VM needed to build it.
    
    It still needs a more complete fix, but this allows compiles to
    progress until that is completed.

    nls (en_US) Re-remove long compositions that override shorter
    
    As reported in <https://bugs.freedesktop.org/show_bug.cgi?id=17228>:
    
      Commit a6f4bbf7
        nls (en_US): remove long compositions that override shorter [...]
        removed some longer compose sequences because there are shorter
        ones which take preference over the longer. For example the
        sequences:
    
          <Multi_key> <apostrophe> <comma> <c>   : U1E09 # ḉ
          <Multi_key> <apostrophe> <comma> <C>   : U1E08 # Ḉ
    
        were removed becase there already was:
    
          <Multi_key> <apostrophe> <comma>       : U201A # ‚
    
      Then commit 4ba09125
        Work on making the en_US and pt_BR UTF-8 Compose as similar as
        possible added exactly the same key sequences again. Obviusly
        they won't work.

    Add more <Multi_key> <cedilla> Compose tuples
    
    The last commit missed the el_GR UTF-8 Compose.pre as well as
    the various ISO 8859 locales which have compose sequences
    generating ‘WITH CEDILLA’ characters.
    
    (Interestingly, some of the 8859 locales already supported
    <Multi_key> <cedilla> for some CEDILLA characters, but not
    for Ç or ç.)
    
    This is further work on bug 10397.

    Work on making the en_US and pt_BR UTF-8 Compose as similar as possible.
    
    The eventual goal here is to have a single primary UTF-8 Compose
    file which the locale-specific UTF-8 Compose.pre files can #include.

    Add <Multi_key> <cedilla> Compose tuples
    
    The en_US and pt_BR UTF-8 Compose tables had support for using <comma>
    with <Multi_key> to enter CEDILLA characters.  Bug 10397 requests
    support for using <cedilla> instead of <comma> in said sequences.
    
    This commit makes both styles work.

    <A> and <dead_belowdot> <a> compose sequences for letters U+1E00 and
    U+U1E01 (LATIN CAPITAL/SMALL LETTER A WITH RING BELOW). This caused
    duplicate compose sequences since these have already been defined. Also,
    using <dead_belowring> is more logical since the diacritic is indeed
    a "RING BELOW".

    Fix fd.o bug 15023: make Xlib sync correctly given many void requests
    
    If given many requests without replies, Xlib may not sync until it flushes
    the output buffer.  Thus, if Xlib can fit enough requests in the buffer to
    pass by the number of requests it would normally sync after (65536 -
    BUFSIZE/sizeof(xReq)), it will sync too late.  The test case in bug 15023
    demonstrated this by issuing a request with a reply (ListExtensions) at
    just the right time to get confused with the GetInputFocus reply issued in
    response to the sync 65,536 requests later; the test case used an async
    handler to watch the replies, since otherwise it could not issue a request
    without waiting for the response.  When the test case failed, Xlib's sync
    handler would eat the ListExtensions reply, and the test case's async
    handler would see the GetInputFocus reply.
    
    Fix this by replacing SEQLIMIT with a function sync_hazard() that uses the
    buffer size to figure out when the sequence numbers could potentially wrap
    before the next flush.
    
    With this commit, the test case consistently passed, and the async reply
    handler always saw the ListExtensions reply.

    Fix the <U\x+> keysyms in the en_US.UTF-8 Compose file
    
    Based on src/KeysymStr.c and src/StrKeysym.c and comments in
    bugs #11930¹ and #5129² it is clear that <U100XXXXX> is invalid;
    those should be in the form U plus the hex of the UCS Code Point.
    
    The 0x01000000 is ORed in by the code.
    
    This update fixes all of those.

    Use the new dead_psili and dead_dasia keysyms added to proto/x11proto 7.0.11
    Inspired by bug 11930¹:
    
    Commit 40ed4eef92e31fcf7ea0a436e1a00cdf49484c1b to x11proto added dead_psili
    and dead_dasia keysyms.  Make use of them in the en_US.UTF-8 and el_GR.UTF-8

    Patch for Catalan locales
    From bugzilla bug 10943¹:
    
      There are several Catalan locale codes which presently can
      be used in X11 systems; especially after they were accepted
      in belocs-locale-data².
    
      In the following patches, I³ add ca_AD, ca_FR and ca_IT Catalan
      locale codes.  For instance, without this, using ca_AD (actually
      a quite used locale⁴) some applications (eg. Emacs or Skype)
      cannot display Catalan diacritic marks as you type them.

    Compose fix for Latin-1 (from Debian)
    The description from bugzilla bug 7417¹ is:
    
      We've been shipping this patch for some time in Debian now. The
      problem description from the patch header is reproduced below. You
      may want to note the licensing issue mentioned below, but we've been
      shipping it because the method by which this particular patch was
      generated and updated was also given below.
    
      This patch by Denis Barbier.
    
      The X11 protocol states that Unicode keysyms are in the range
      0x01000100 - 0x0110FFFF.  If the result of composing characters is a
      Unicode codepoint, X returns the corresponding Unicode keysym, which
      is its Unicode codepoint augmented by 0x01000000.  Latin-1
      characters must not appear with their Unicode codepoints in compose
      files, otherwise the returned composed character lies in the range
      0x01000000 - 0x010000FF which is not valid.
    
      There are two solutions: either fix composing routines to return
      0xZZ instead of 0x010000ZZ (where Z is an hexadecimal digit), or
      replace U00ZZ by their corresponding keysyms in compose files.  The
      latter is more logical and less error prone, so compose files will
      be patched.  Many applications accept these invalid Unicode keysyms,
      but few of them don't, most notably xemacs.  Only UTF-8 locales are
      affected.
    
      This has been fixed very recently in XFree86 CVS (but not xorg), but
      for licensing reasons, this patch is not grabbed.  Instead automatic
      conversion is performed by:
    
        sed -e '/XK_LATIN1/,/XK_LATIN1/!d' /usr/include/X11/keysymdef.h \
        | grep -v deprecated | grep 0x0 \
        | sed -e 's/0x0/U0/' -e 's/XK_//' \
        | awk '{ printf "s/\\b%s\\b/%s/ig\n", $3, $2; }' > sedfile
        for f in nls/*.UTF-8/Compose.pre
        do
          sed -f sedfile $f > $f.tmp && mv $f.tmp $f
        done
    
    [I edited the quoted script to update it for the current location of
    the installed keysymdef.h and the current layout of the libX11
    repo. -JimC]
    
    I applied the script, not the patch attached to the bugreport.

    Fix locking in _XimGetWindowEventmask.
    
    Now that XFilterEvent drops the Display lock before invoking callback
    functions, _XimGetWindowEventmask is called without the lock held. So
    when it called _XGetWindowAttributes, a variant of XGetWindowAttributes
    that does not lock the Display, Xlib/XCB would assert:
    
    xcb_xlib.c:50: xcb_xlib_unlock: Assertion `c->xlib.lock' failed.
    
    Should fix Gentoo #156367, Ubuntu #87947, Debian #427296. And others?

    Xlib/XCB: Fix _XReadEvents to always enqueue a new event, even if an error occurs
    
    Commit c337f9de7cfd89f983f83956b7457a274dd412f3 broke the invariant that
    _XReadEvents always enqueues at least one event even if an error occurred,
    because the one call to xcb_wait_for_event would then return an error, not an
    event, and nothing else ensured that process_responses would obtain an event.
    Fix this by reverting most of c337f9de7cfd89f983f83956b7457a274dd412f3 and
    f417570735aac865eb6b576d1ea76b5bfcd8573b and implementing the correct fix.  In
    process_responses, wait_for_first_event now serves as a flag, cleared when
    actually handling an event.

    This reverts commit c9e28e05ae01ce8a29bea09df759b6271865b44c.
    
    The installed XlibInt.h includes XlibConf.h , so libX11 should ship
    XlibConf.h.  (Commit c9e28e05ae01ce8a29bea09df759b6271865b44c didn't actually
    prevent automake from shipping XlibConf.h, because it used
    nodist_x11include_HEADERS rather than nodist_HEADERS.)

    Hold XCB's Xlib lock even when only the user lock (XLockDisplay) is held.
    
    An Xlib client can query Display state, such as with NextRequest, while
    it holds only the Xlib user lock (between XLockDisplay and
    XUnlockDisplay), so XCB requests in other threads should be blocked when
    the Xlib user lock is held.
    
    We acquire the lock even when XInitThreads was not called, so that pure
    XCB code can use multiple threads even in an otherwise single-threaded
    Xlib application.

    Allow re-entrant Xlib calls from _XIOError.
    
    Some libraries try to clean up X resources from atexit handlers, _fini,
    or C++ destructors. To make these work, the Display lock should be
    downgraded to a user lock (as in XLockDisplay) before calling exit(3).
    This blocks Xlib calls from threads other than the one calling exit(3)
    while still allowing the exit handlers to call Xlib.
    
    This assumes that the thread calling exit will call any atexit handlers.
    If this does not hold, then an alternate solution would involve
    registering an atexit handler to take over the lock, which would only
    assume that the same thread calls all the atexit handlers.

    Debian bug #354315: Clarify return value in XGetWindowAttributes man page
    
    This man page does not discuss the actual return values of the
    function, but says they are of type "Status".  One might assume
    that this means you could compare it with the "Success" macro.
    One would be wrong.
    
    The X functions seem to have two three types representing status.
    If it is an "int" there are a number of error codes or "Success"
    which can be compared against.  If it is a bool, the result can be
    compared with "True" or "False".  If the return type is "Status" it
    appears that the return type is either 0 or 1.  Unfortunately the
    value for Success is zero, so it is important to distinguish
    between the first two types of return values and the third;
    otherwise the conditional will be inverted.
    
    XGetWindowAttributes() is one of the functions which returns zero
    for failure.  The man page should make this clear.

    Bug #9154: Always process an event for _XReadEvents, even if an error occurs
    
    Previously, process_responses (in the wait_for_first_event case called
    from _XReadEvents) considered any return from xcb_wait_for_event
    sufficient to think it had processed an event. If xcb_wait_for_event
    returned an error, and no more events occurred before process_responses
    called xcb_poll_for_event, process_responses would try to return with
    dpy->head NULL, and would fail an assertion for the _XReadEvents
    postcondition. Now, process_responses continues using xcb_wait_for_event
    until it gets an event.

    Add note in man-page that XListFontsWithInfo is not thread-safe.
    
    _XReply drops the Display lock, so the value of dpy->request may change

    I discovered this by inspection a year or two ago. I'm pretty confident
    in the claim, and nobody has come up with an argument for why it's safe
    despite appearances.

    Bug #8622: Fix response processing order for threaded apps
    
    Previously, process_responses (the common code for _XReply,
    _XReadEvents, and _XEventsQueued) took the current request sequence
    number as an argument, and did some highly complicated processing to
    attempt to process responses in order across threads.  This didn't
    actually work.
    
    Now, process_responses handles responses in order, by adding condition
    variables to the list of outstanding requests in
    dpy->xcb->pending_requests, and blocking on them when those requests
    should get processed to allow _XReply to process them; if actually
    called from _XReply, it returns when _XReply's request should get
    processed.  _XReply broadcasts on the condition variable after it has
    read its reply and re-acquired the display lock.
    
    Another great commit brought to you by Jamey Sharp, Josh Triplett, the
    Gobby collaborative text editor, conspy, and ridiculous amounts of SSH
    forwarding.

    We can never change the libX11 soname, and we don't want to commit to never
    changing the public Xlib/XCB functions, so split them into a separate library
    libX11-xcb.  This also means that a program linked solely against libX11
    should work with either Xlib or Xlib/XCB, which will make life easier for
    package maintainers.

    Work around recent autoconf (2.59?) changes in directory expansion.
    
    Recent autoconf versions have changed how directory names are managed in the
    configure.ac script; automatic 'eval' invocations now occur as a part of the
    AC_DEFINE_DIR macro which make it imperative that AC_DEFINE_DIR be executed
    before the variables are used in further macro definitions. Also, ${datadir}
    is apparantly an old name for ${datarootdir} as ${datadir} doesn't get
    expanded correctly by AC_DEFINE_DIR. This looks like an autoconf bug, but it
    is easy to work around by just using ${datarootdir} instead of ${datadir}.

    Generate locale.alias and compose.dir exactly like we do in the monolith, which fixes non-UTF-8 locales in particular (so we get foo: bar, as well as foo bar). Switch to generating locale.dir the same way.

    Enable loadable i18n modules, making them configurable on the configure command line.
    Clean up conditionals for XKB, XCMS, XLOCALEDIR
    Create new lib directory for locale modules in ${X11_LIBDIR}/locale/lib. Add this to the default XLOCALEDIR search path.
    Create separate X11_LOCALEDATADIR variable pointing at ${datadir}/X11/locale for installing locale data.
    Split out xcms, xkb, xlibi18n sources from main xlib bits so they can be conditionally included more easily. Lots of source files have been moved with this step; the result seems like it might be easier to maintain.
    Display message at end of configure script with selected options.
    Fix manual building with cpp to add -traditional in cpprules.in. This isn't conditionalized at all, so it will break on systems not using GNU cpp.

    Quote $ac_cv_search_* variables to prevent errors from test when they are set to "none required" (as happens on Solaris since dlopen is in libc)
    Comment out "override CC = gcc" line as it breaks builds with non-GNU makes, and its incorrect to force a specific compiler. Change LINK line from gcc to $(CC).

    - Check for xproto as its CFLAGS are needed in the .pc file

commit 46e8d8a65430dd87c10b066b5cff99a689c22241
Author: Egbert Eich <eich-at-freedesktop-dot-org>
Date:   Tue May 17 08:10:10 2005 +0000

    gcc4 allows to check if sentinels are correct (a sentinel is the terminating element in a varargs list). A sentinel needs to be NULL, not 0 - which doesn't make a difference on 32bit but matters on 64bit. Furthermore it can be told that functions have a printf-like format string and argument list so that they can verify that both match. To use these features certain attributes need to be set - which are compiler specific. To do this we define macros which are expanded depending on the compiler version. For now we put those in include/Xfuncproto.h (the XFree86 DDX layer contains a file compiler.h which however is not visible outside the DDX) (Bugzilla #3268).

    Added support for UTF-8 in ja_JP, ko_KR and zh_TW locales (Mike Fabian).
    Changed default encoding for ru from KOI8-R to ISO8859-5 (Mike Fabian). This is the encoding that is also used by glibc. We may break other libcs - lets see who complains.
    Added explanation for DESTDIR to install to a different directory than /.
    Added some early bailouts to atiprobe if PCI structure pointer is NULL to prevent sig11.
    XV support doesn't depend on 2D acceleration any more. This patch removes this limitation from the NSC driver. This is a patch that I have committed to XFree86 a while ago but never ported over to X.Org. Matthieu Herrb contributed some build fixes.
    Fixing SetDPMSTimers() so that DPMS*Time == 0 disables the appropriate timer. This takes advantage of the fact that TimerSet() with a timeout argument 0 behaves like TimerCanel().
    Use /dev/xconsole (named pipe) or devpts for system logger (Werner Fink).
    Create missing links for backward compatibility to XFree86 (Stefan Dirsch).
    Changed comment to mention xorg.
    Changed cursor for the 'kill' action from XC_draped_box to XC_Pirate. If you don't like it we can change it back (original author unkown).
    Added 'pic' to the man page rendering command pipeline (Werner Fink).

    Fixed some lockups in XIM code when the application is running with multi thread support. These lockups occur deep down in XFilterEvents() which itself locks when another Xlib function gets called that also locks. This fixes two instances by separating those Xlib functions into an internal (non-locking) call and a locking wrapper that is used as an external function. There may be several other such instances therefore another more general patch is eventually required (Bugzilla #1182).

    Improve 'uniqueness' of authorization cookie sent by client for XDM-AUTHORIZATION-1. Old 'uniquness' consisted of the PID of the client, a time stamp (in seconds) and a number obtained by starting to count down from 0xffff. When a client did an XOpenDisplay() then execv'ed a child and did XOpenDisplay() again within the same second, the cookie was identical to the previous one (as the PID did not change but the static 'count down' variable was reinitialized) and thus refused by the server.
