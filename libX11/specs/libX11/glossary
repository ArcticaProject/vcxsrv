X maintains a list of hosts from which client programs can be run.  
By default, 
only programs on the local host and hosts specified in an initial list read

This access control list can be changed by clients on the local host.  
Some server implementations can also implement other authorization mechanisms
in addition to or in place of this mechanism.
The action of this mechanism can be conditional based on the authorization 
protocol name and data received by the server at connection setup.

For display in X,
there can be a direct mapping from a charset to one font,
if the width of all characters in the charset is either one or two bytes.
A text string encoded in an encoding such as Shift-JIS cannot be passed
directly to the X server, because the text imaging requests accept only
single-width charsets (either 8 or 16 bits).
Charsets which meet these restrictions can serve as ``font charsets''.
Font charsets strictly speaking map font indices to font glyphs,
not characters to character glyphs.

for example, ISO8859-1.

Windows can have associated properties that consist of a name, a type,
a data format, and some data. 
The protocol places no interpretation on properties. 
They are intended as a general-purpose naming mechanism for clients.  
For example, clients might use properties to share information such as resize
hints, program names, and icon formats with a window manager.

RGB values are the red, green, and blue intensity values that are used

The save set of a client is a list of other clients' windows that,

This would be the expected configuration when there is only a single keyboard

\fBSelection\fP
.IN "Selection" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
A selection can be thought of as an indirect property with dynamic
type.
That is, rather than having the property stored in the X server,
it is maintained by some client (the owner).
A selection is global and is thought of as belonging to the user 
and being maintained by clients, 
rather than being private to a particular window subhierarchy
or a particular set of clients.
When a client asks for the contents of
a selection, it specifies a selection target type,
which can be used to control the transmitted representation of the contents.
For example, if the selection is ``the last thing the user clicked on,''
and that is currently an image, then the target type might specify
whether the contents of the image should be sent in XY format or
Z format.
.IP
The target type can also be used to control the class of
contents transmitted; for example, 
asking for the ``looks'' (fonts, line
spacing, indentation, and so forth) of a paragraph selection, rather than the
text of the paragraph.
The target type can also be used for other
purposes.
The protocol does not constrain the semantics.
.KE

\fBServer\fP
.IN "Server" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
The server, which is also referred to as the X server,

and demultiplexes input back to the appropriate clients.
.KE

\fBServer grabbing\fP
.IN "Server" "grabbing" "@DEF@"

The server can be grabbed by a single client for exclusive use.

pop-up menus, or executing requests indivisibly.

The relationship between sibling windows is known as the stacking order.

\fBState-dependent encoding\fP
.IN "State-dependent encoding" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
An encoding in which an invocation of a charset can apply to multiple
characters in sequence.
A state-dependent encoding begins in an ``initial state'' 
and enters other ``shift states'' when specific ``shift sequences'' 
are encountered in the byte sequence.
In ISO2022 terms,
this means use of locking shifts, not single shifts.
.KE

\fBState-independent encoding\fP
.IN "State-independent encoding" "" "@DEF@"

pairwise equivalent to decimal values 97 to 122 inclusive
(characters ``a'' to ``z''), decimal values 192 to 214 inclusive
(characters ``A grave'' to ``O diaeresis'') are pairwise equivalent to decimal

\fBTimestamp\fP
.IN "Timestamp" "" "@DEF@"
.IP
A timestamp is a time value expressed in milliseconds. 
It is typically the time since the last server reset.
Timestamp values wrap around (after about 49.7 days).
The server, given its current time is represented by timestamp T, 
always interprets timestamps from clients by treating half 
of the timestamp space as being earlier in time than T 
and half of the timestamp space as being later in time than T.
One timestamp value, represented by the constant 
.PN CurrentTime ,
is never generated by the server. 
This value is reserved for use in requests to represent the current server time.

A type is an arbitrary atom used to identify the interpretation of property

A window is viewable if it and all of its ancestors are mapped.
