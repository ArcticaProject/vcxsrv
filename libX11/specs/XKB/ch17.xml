<title>The Xkb Compatibility Map</title>

<para>
As shown in Figure 17.1, the X server is normally dealing with more than one
client, each of which may be receiving events from the keyboard, and each of
which may issue requests to modify the keyboard in some manner. Each client may
be either Xkb-unaware, Xkb-capable, or Xkb-aware. The server itself may be
either Xkb-aware or Xkb-unaware. If the server is Xkb-unaware, Xkb state and
keyboard mappings are not involved in any manner, and Xkb-aware clients may not
issue Xkb requests to the server. If the server is Xkb-aware, the server must
be able to deliver events and accept requests in which the keyboard state and
mapping are compatible with the mode in which the client is operating.
Consequently, for some situations, conversions must be made between Xkb state /
keyboard mappings and core protocol state / keyboard mappings, and vice versa.

<para>
In addition to these situations involving a single server, there are cases
where a client that deals with multiple servers may need to configure keyboards
on different servers to be similar and the different servers may not all be
Xkb-aware. Finally, a client may be dealing with descriptions of keyboards
(files, and so on) that are based on core protocol and therefore may need to be
able to map these descriptions to Xkb descriptions.
</para>


<para>
An Xkb-aware server maintains keyboard state and mapping as an Xkb keyboard
state and an Xkb keyboard mapping plus a compatibility map used to convert from
Xkb components to core components and vice versa. In addition, the server also
maintains a core keyboard mapping that approximates the Xkb keyboard mapping.
The core keyboard mapping may be updated piecemeal, on a per-key basis. When
the server receives a core protocol <emphasis>
ChangeKeyboardMapping</emphasis>
 or <emphasis>
SetModifierMapping</emphasis>
 request, it updates its core keyboard mapping, then uses the compatibility map
to update its Xkb keyboard mapping. When the server receives an <emphasis>
XkbSetMap</emphasis>
 request, it updates those portions of its Xkb keyboard mapping specified by
the request, then uses its compatibility map to update the corresponding parts
of its core keyboard map. Consequently, the server’s Xkb keyboard map and
also its core keyboard map may contain components that were set directly and
others that were computed. Figure 17.2 illustrates these relationships.
</para>

client-side data structures.</para></note>

<para>
All configurable aspects of mapping Xkb state and configuration to and from
core protocol state and configuration are defined by a compatibility map,
contained in an <emphasis>

transformations are made.

<sect2 id='Xkb_State_to_Core_Protocol_State_Transformation'>
<title>Xkb State to Core Protocol State Transformation</title>

<para>
As shown in Figure 17.3, there are four <emphasis>
group compatibility maps</emphasis>
 (contained in <emphasis>
groups</emphasis>
 [0..3]) in the <emphasis>
XkbCompatMapRec</emphasis>
 structure, one per possible Xkb group. Each group compatibility map is a
modifier definition (see section 7.2 for a description of modifier
definitions). The <emphasis>
mask</emphasis>
 component of the definition specifies which real modifiers should be set in
the core protocol state field when the corresponding group is active. Because
only one group is active at any one time, only one of the four possible
transformations is ever applied at any one point in time. If the device
described by the <emphasis>
XkbDescRec</emphasis>
 does not support four groups, the extra groups fields are present, but
undefined.
</para>

<para>
Normally, the Xkb-aware server reports keyboard state in the <emphasis>

 member of events such as a <emphasis>
KeyPress</emphasis>
 event and <emphasis>

For Xkb-unaware clients, only core protocol keyboard information may be

</para>

</sect2>
<sect2 id='Core_Keyboard_Mapping_to_Xkb_Keyboard_Mapping_Transformation'>
<title>Core Keyboard Mapping to Xkb Keyboard Mapping Transformation</title>

<para>
When a core protocol keyboard mapping request is received by the server, the
server’s core keyboard map is updated, and then the Xkb map maintained by the
server is updated. Because a client may have explicitly configured some of the
Xkb keyboard mapping in the server, this automatic regeneration of the Xkb
keyboard mapping from the core protocol keyboard mapping should not modify any
components of the Xkb keyboard mapping that were explicitly set by a client.
The client must set explicit override controls to prevent this from happening
(see section 16.3). The core-to-Xkb mapping is done as follows:
</para>

<orderedlist>
  <listitem>
    <para>
Map the symbols from the keys in the core keyboard map to groups and symbols on
keys in the Xkb keyboard map. The core keyboard mapping is of fixed width, so
each key in the core mapping has the same number of symbols associated with it.
The Xkb mapping allows a different number of symbols to be associated with each
key; those symbols may be divided into a different number of groups (1-4) for
each key. For each key, this process therefore involves partitioning the fixed
number of symbols from the core mapping into a set of variable-length groups
with a variable number of symbols in each group. For example, if the core
protocol map is of width five, the partition for one key might result in one
group with two symbols and another with three symbols. A different key might
result in two groups with two symbols plus a third group with one symbol. The
core protocol map requires at least two symbols in each of the first two
groups.
    </para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>
For each changed key, determine the number of groups represented in the new
core keyboard map. This results in a tentative group count for each key in the
Xkb map.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
For each changed key, determine the number of symbols in each of the groups
found in step 1a. There is one explicit override control associated with each
of the four possible groups for each Xkb key, <emphasis>
ExplicitKeyType1</emphasis>
 through <emphasis>
ExplicitKeyType4</emphasis>
. If no explicit override control is set for a group, the number of symbols
used for that group from the core map is two.  If the explicit override control
is set for a group on the key, the number of symbols used for that Xkb group
from the core map is the width of the Xkb group with one exception: because of
the core protocol requirement for at least two symbols in each of groups one
and two, the number of symbols used for groups one and two is the maximum of 2
or the width of the Xkb group.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
For each changed key, assign the symbols in the core map to the appropriate
group on the key. If the total number of symbols required by the Xkb map for a
particular key needs more symbols than the core protocol map contains, the
additional symbols are taken to be <emphasis>
NoSymbol</emphasis>
 keysyms appended to the end of the core set. If the core map contains more
symbols than are needed by the Xkb map, trailing symbols in the core map are
discarded. In the absence of an explicit override for group one or two, symbols
are assigned in order by group; the first symbols in the core map are assigned
to group one, in order, followed by group two, and so on. For example, if the
core map contained eight symbols per key, and a particular Xkb map contained 2
symbols for G1 and G2 and three for G3, the symbols would be assigned as (G is
group, L is shift level):
        </para>
<literallayout>
          G1L1 G1L2 G2L1 G2L2 G3L1 G3L2 G3L3
</literallayout>
        <para>
If an explicit override control is set for group one or two, the symbols are
taken from the core set in a somewhat different order. The first four symbols
from the core set are assigned to G1L1, G1L2, G2L1, G2L2, respectively. If
group one requires more symbols, they are taken next, and then any additional
symbols needed by group two. Group three and four symbols are taken in complete
sequence after group two. For example, a key with four groups and three symbols
in each group would take symbols from the core set in the following order:
        </para>
<literallayout>
G1L1 G1L2 G2L1 G2L2 G1L3 G2L3 G3L1 G3L2 G3L3 G4L1 G4L2 G4L3
</literallayout>
        <para>
As previously noted, the core protocol map requires at lease two symbols in
groups one and two. Because of this, if an explicit override control for an Xkb
key is set and group one and / or group two is of width one, it is not possible
to generate the symbols taken from the core protocol set and assigned to
position G1L2 and / or G2L2.
        </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>
For each group on each changed key, assign a key type appropriate for the
symbols in the group.

<title>Xkb Keyboard Mapping to Core Keyboard Mapping Transformations</title>

<para>
Whenever the server processes Xkb requests to change the keyboard mapping, it
discards the affected portion of its core keyboard mapping and regenerates it
based on the new Xkb mapping.
</para>


<para>
When the Xkb mapping for a key is transformed to a core protocol mapping, the
symbols for the core map are taken in the following order from the Xkb map:
</para>


<para>
G1L1 G1L2 G2L1 G2L2 G1L3-n G2L3-n G3L1-n G4L1-n
</para>


<para>
If group one is of width one in the Xkb map, G1L2 is taken to be NoSymbol;
similarly, if group two is of width one in the Xkb map, G2L2 is taken to be
NoSymbol.
</para>


<para>
If the Xkb key map for a particular key has fewer groups than the core
keyboard, the symbols for group one are repeated to fill in the missing core
components. For example, an Xkb key with a single width-three group would be
mapped to a core mapping counting three groups as:
</para>


<para>
G1L1 G1L2 G1L1 G1L2 G1L3 G1L3 G1L1 G1L2 G1L3
</para>


<para>
When a core keyboard map entry is generated from an Xkb keyboard map entry, a
modifier mapping is generated as well. The modifier mapping contains all of the
modifiers affected by any of the actions associated with the key combined with
all of the real modifiers associated with any of the virtual modifiers bound to
the key. In addition, if any of the actions associated with the key affect any
component of the keyboard group, all of the modifiers in the <emphasis>
mask</emphasis>
 field of all of the group compatibility maps are added to the modifier mapping
as well. While an <emphasis>
XkbSA_ISOLock</emphasis>
 action can theoretically affect any modifier, if the Xkb mapping for a key
specifies an <emphasis>
XkbSA_ISOLock</emphasis>
 action, only the modifiers or group that are set by default are added to the
modifier mapping.

compatibility map may be used to reconfigure other servers.
