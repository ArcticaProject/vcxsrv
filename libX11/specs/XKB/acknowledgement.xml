This document is the result of a great deal of hard work by a great
many people. Without Erik Fortuneâ€™s work as Architect of the X
Keyboard Extension and the longtime support of Silicon Graphics
Inc. there would not be a keyboard extension.

Most of all, we thank Gary Aitken and Amber J. Benson for their long
hours and late nights as ultimate authors of this specification, and
for serving as authors, document editors, and XKB protocol and
implementation reviewers. Their commitment to accuracy and completeness,
their attention to detail, their keen insight, and their good natures
when working under tremendous pressure are in some measure responsible
not only for the quality of this document, but for the quality of the
Keyboard extension itself.
