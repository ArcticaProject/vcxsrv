The files in this directory are taken from the libiconv-1.1 package.

The *.h files were generated from tables (mostly from ftp.unicode.org) using
the programs '8bit_tab_to_h.c' and 'cjk_tab_to_h.c'. On some of them, further
optimizations were applied by hand.

If you find a bug in these files, instead of modifying them in XFree86
and let it diverge from libiconv, please notify the libiconv maintainer
(currently <bruno@clisp.org>) so he can fix both in synch.
