This is the libX11 from XFree86.

The goal of this project are (1) to get libX11 out of the huge
XF86 hunk of code, (2) to make it buildable with autotools, and
(3) keep the ability to easily merge bug fixes from libX11 in
XF86 into this code, (4) make it possible for people to work with
Xlib without having to deal with the entire XFree86 distribution,
so that bugs can get detected and fixed, (5) provide a place to
move the X library forward.

1 and 2 are related in that a new build system will need to be
developed to get libX11 building outside of the XF86 tree.
Autotools was chosen for a variety of reasons, not the least
of which was that it is very common in the open source community.

For 3, notice that the directory structure of the src subdirectory
is congruant to the directory structure of xc/lib/X11 in the
XFree86 tree. Absolutely, do not break this unless this becomes
the dominant libX11. This allows easier incorporation of patches
from the XFree86 libX11.

For 4, notice that the library can be built without having to build
everything else, so you can build and test enhancements without
replacing your entire X distribution.

For 5, see the xlibs@pdx.freedesktop.org mailing list.  For example,
lots of "stuff" was pushed into Xlib that should have been stand-alone
libraries, since they are not of universal interest and touch the X
wire protocol.  (Mea culpa; a mistake I made 15 years ago that didn't
matter much in the days before shared libraries has been amplified for
aeons- jg).  And Xlib does not tolerate loss of its connection well,
and so on...

Thanks for checking this package out, Warren Turkal and Jim Gettys.
