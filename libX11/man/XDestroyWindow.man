.SH NAME
XDestroyWindow, XDestroySubwindows \- destroy windows
.SH SYNTAX
.HP
int XDestroyWindow\^(\^Display *\fIdisplay\fP\^, Window \fIw\fP\^); 
.HP
int XDestroySubwindows\^(\^Display *\fIdisplay\fP\^, Window \fIw\fP\^); 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fIw\fP 1i
Specifies the window.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.ZN XDestroyWindow
function destroys the specified window as well as all of its subwindows and causes
the X server to generate a
.ZN DestroyNotify
event for each window.
The window should never be referenced again.
If the window specified by the w argument is mapped,
it is unmapped automatically.
The ordering of the
.ZN DestroyNotify
events is such that for any given window being destroyed,
.ZN DestroyNotify
is generated on any inferiors of the window before being generated on
the window itself.
The ordering among siblings and across subhierarchies is not otherwise
constrained.
If the window you specified is a root window, no windows are destroyed.
Destroying a mapped window will generate 
.ZN Expose 
events on other windows that were obscured by the window being destroyed.
.LP
.ZN XDestroyWindow
can generate a
.ZN BadWindow 
error.
.LP
The
.ZN XDestroySubwindows
function destroys all inferior windows of the specified window, 
in bottom-to-top stacking order.
It causes the X server to generate a
.ZN DestroyNotify
event for each window.
If any mapped
subwindows were actually destroyed,
.ZN XDestroySubwindows
causes the X server to generate 
.ZN Expose 
events on the specified window.
This is much more efficient than deleting many windows
one at a time because much of the work need be performed only once for all
of the windows, rather than for each window.
The subwindows should never be referenced again.  
.LP
.ZN XDestroySubwindows
can generate a
.ZN BadWindow 
error.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 1i
.ZN BadWindow
A value for a Window argument does not name a defined Window.
