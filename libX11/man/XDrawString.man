XDrawString, XDrawString16 \- draw text characters
.SH SYNTAX
.HP

\fIgc\fP\^, int \fIx\fP\^, int \fIy\fP\^, char *\fIstring\fP\^, int

.SH ARGUMENTS
.IP \fId\fP 1i
Specifies the drawable. 
.IP \fIdisplay\fP 1i
Specifies the connection to the X server.
.IP \fIgc\fP 1i
Specifies the GC.
.IP \fIlength\fP 1i
Specifies the number of characters in the string argument.
.IP \fIstring\fP 1i
Specifies the character string.
.ds Xy , which are relative to the origin of the specified drawable \
and define the origin of the first character
.IP \fIx\fP 1i
.br
.ns
.IP \fIy\fP 1i
Specify the x and y coordinates\*(Xy.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Each character image, as defined by the font in the GC, is treated as an
additional mask for a fill operation on the drawable.
The drawable is modified only where the font character has a bit set to 1.
For fonts defined with 2-byte matrix indexing
and used with
.ZN XDrawString16 ,
each byte is used as a byte2 with a byte1 of zero.
.LP
Both functions use these GC components: 
function, plane-mask, fill-style, font, subwindow-mode, clip-x-origin, 
clip-y-origin, and clip-mask.
They also use these GC mode-dependent components: 
foreground, background, tile, stipple, tile-stipple-x-origin, 
and tile-stipple-y-origin.
.LP
.ZN XDrawString
and
.ZN XDrawString16
can generate
.ZN BadDrawable ,
.ZN BadGC ,
and
.ZN BadMatch 
errors.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 1i
.ZN BadDrawable
A value for a Drawable argument does not name a defined Window or Pixmap.
.TP 1i
.ZN BadGC
A value for a GContext argument does not name a defined GContext.
.TP 1i
.ZN BadMatch
An
.ZN InputOnly
window is used as a Drawable.
.TP 1i
.ZN BadMatch
Some argument or pair of arguments has the correct type and range but fails
to match in some other way required by the request.
