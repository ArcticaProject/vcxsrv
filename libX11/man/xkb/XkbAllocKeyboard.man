.SH NAME
XkbAllocKeyboard \-  Creates a keyboard description from scratch
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B XkbDescRec XkbAllocKeyboard
.BI "(\^void\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Applications seldom need to directly allocate a keyboard description; calling
.I XkbGetKeyboard 
usually suffices. In the event you need to create a keyboard description from 
scratch, however, use 
.I XkbAllocKeyboard 
rather than directly calling 
.I malloc.

If 
.I XkbAllocKeyboard 
fails to allocate the keyboard description, it returns NULL. 
Otherwise, it returns a pointer to an empty keyboard description structure. The 
.I device_spec 
field will have been initialized to XkbUseCoreKbd. You may then 
either fill in the structure components or use Xkb functions to obtain values 
for the structure components from a keyboard device.
