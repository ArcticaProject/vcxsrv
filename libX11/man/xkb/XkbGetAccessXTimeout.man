.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
In environments where computers are shared, features such as SlowKeys present a 
problem: if 
SlowKeys is on, the keyboard can appear to be unresponsive because keys are not 
accepted 
until they are held for a certain period of time. To help solve this problem, 
Xkb provides 
an AccessXTimeout control to automatically change the enabled/disabled state of 
any boolean 
controls and to change the value of the AccessXKeys and AccessXFeedback control 
attributes 
if the keyboard is idle for a specified period of time.

When a timeout as specified by AccessXTimeout occurs and a control is 
consequently modified, 
Xkb generates an XkbControlsNotify event.

.I XkbGetAccessXTimeout 
sends a request to the X server to obtain the current values for the 
AccessXTimeout attributes, waits for a reply, and backfills the values into the 
appropriate arguments. The parameters 
.I options_mask_rtrn 
and 
.I options_values_rtrn 
are backfilled with the options to modify and the values for 
.I ax_options, 
which is a field in the XkbControlsRec structure.
.I XkbGetAccessXTimeout 
returns True if successful; if a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not 
available in the server, 
.I XkbGetAccessXTimeout 
returns False.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
True
The 
.I XkbGetAccessXTimeout 
returns True when it successfully sends a request to the X server to obtain the 
current values for the AccessXTimeout attributes, waits for a reply, and 
backfills the values into the appropriate arguments.
.TP 15
False
The 
.I XkbGetAccessXTimeout 
funtion returns False if a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not 
available in the 
server.
