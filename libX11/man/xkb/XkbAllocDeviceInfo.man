XkbAllocDeviceInfo \- Obtain an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP

.BI "(\^unsigned int " "device_spec" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "n_buttons" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "sz_leds" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- device_spec
device ID with which structure will be used
.TP
.I \- n_buttons
number of button actions to allocate space for
.TP
.I \- sz_leds
number of LED feedbacks to allocate space for
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbAllocDeviceInfo 
allocates space for an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure and initializes that structure's 
.I device_spec 
field with the device ID specified by 
.I device_spec. 
If 
.I n_buttons 
is nonzero, 
.I n_buttons 
XkbActions are linked into the XkbDeviceInfoRec structure and initialized to zero. If 
.I sz_leds 
is nonzero, 
.I sz_leds 
XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structures are also allocated and linked into the XkbDeviceInfoRec structure. If 
you request XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structures be allocated using this request, you must initialize them 
explicitly.

To obtain an XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure, use 
.I XkbAllocDeviceLedInfo.
.SH STRUCTURES
.LP
Information about X Input Extension devices is transferred between a client program and the Xkb 
extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:
