.SH NAME
XkbComputeShapeBounds \- Updates the bounding box of a shape
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B Bool XkbComputeShapeBounds

.I shape
)
.br
      XkbShapePtr \fIshape\fP\^;
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS

shape to be examined
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb provides a number of convenience functions to help use a keyboard geometry. These include 
functions to return the bounding box of a shape's top surface and to update the bounding box 
of a shape row or section.

A shape is made up of a number of outlines. Each outline is a polygon made up of a number of 
points. The bounding box of a shape is a rectangle that contains all the outlines of that 
shape. 

A ShapeRec contains a BoundsRec that describes the bounds of the shape. If you add or delete 
an outline to or from a shape, the bounding box must be updated.

.I XkbComputeShapeBounds 
updates the BoundsRec contained in the 
.I shape 
by examining all the outlines of the shape and setting the BoundsRec to the minimum x and 
minimum y, and maximum x and maximum y values found in those outlines. 
.I XkbComputeShapeBounds 
returns False if 
.I shape 
is NULL or if there are no outlines for the shape; otherwise, it returns True.

If you add or delete a key to or from a row, or if you update the shape of one of the keys in that row, you may need to update the bounding box of that row. To update the bounding box of a row, use 
.I XkbComputeRowBounds.
