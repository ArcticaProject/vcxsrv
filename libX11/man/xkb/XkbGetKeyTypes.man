.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbGetKeyTypes 
queries the server for the desired types, waits for a reply, and returns the 
desired types in the 
.I xkb->map->types. 
If successful, it returns Success.

.I XkbGetKeyTypes 
returns BadAccess if the Xkb extension has not been properly initialized and 
BadValue if the combination of 
.I first 
and 
.I num 
results in numbers out of valid range.

.B NOTE: 
.I XkbGetKeyTypes 
is used to obtain descriptions of the key types themselves, not the key types 
bound to individual keys. To obtain the key types bound to an individual key, 
refer to the 
.I key_sym_map 
field of the client map.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadAccess
The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized
