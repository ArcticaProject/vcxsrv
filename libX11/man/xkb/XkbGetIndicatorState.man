.TH XkbGetIndicatorState __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbGetIndicatorState \- Obtains the current state of the keyboard indicators
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Status XkbGetIndicatorState
.BI "(\^Display *" "display" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "device_spec" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "state_return" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- display
connection to the X server
.TP
.I \- device_spec
device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd
.TP
.I \- state_return
backfilled with a mask of the indicator state
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb allows applications to obtain information about indicators using two 
different methods. The first method, which is similar to the core X 
implementation, uses a mask to specify the indicators. The second method, which 
is more suitable for applications concerned with interoperability, uses 
indicator names. The correspondence between the indicator name and the bit 
position in masks is as follows: one of the parameters returned from
.I XkbGetNamedIndicators 
is an index that is the bit position to use in any function call that requires a 
mask of indicator bits, as well as the indicator's index into the 
XkbIndicatorRec array of indicator maps.

.I XkbGetIndicatorState 
queries the 
.I display 
for the state of the indicators on the device specified by the 
.I device_spec. 
For each indicator that is "turned on" on the device, the associated bit is set 
in 
.I state_return. 
If a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not available in the server,
.I XkbGetIndicatorState
returns a BadMatch error. Otherwise, it sends the request to the X server, 
places the state of the indicators into 
.I state_return, 
and returns Success. Thus the value reported by 
.I XkbGetIndicatorState 
is identical to the value reported by the core protocol.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadMatch
A compatible version of Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has 
correct type and range, but is otherwise invalid
