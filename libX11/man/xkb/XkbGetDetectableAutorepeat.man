.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Auto-repeat is the generation of multiple key events by a keyboard when the user
presses a key and holds it down. Keyboard hardware and device-dependent X server
software often implement auto-repeat by generating multiple KeyPress events with no
intervening KeyRelease event. The standard behavior of the X server is to generate
a KeyRelease event for every KeyPress event. If the keyboard hardware and
device-dependent software of the X server implement auto-repeat by generating
multiple KeyPress events, the device-independent part of the X server by default
synthetically generates a KeyRelease event after each KeyPress event. This provides
predictable behavior for X clients, but does not allow those clients to detect the
fact that a key is auto-repeating.

Xkb allows clients to request
.I detectable auto-repeat.
If a client requests and the server supports DetectableAutoRepeat, Xkb generates
KeyRelease events only when the key is physically released. If DetectableAutoRepeat
is not supported or has not been requested, the server synthesizes a KeyRelease
event for each repeating KeyPress event it generates.

DetectableAutoRepeat, unlike other controls, is not contained in the XkbControlsRec
structure, nor can it be enabled or disabled via the EnabledControls control.
Instead, query and set DetectableAutoRepeat using
.I XkbGetDetectableAutoRepeat
and
.I XkbSetDetectableAutoRepeat.

DetectableAutoRepeat is a condition that applies to all keyboard devices for a
client's connection to a given X server; it cannot be selectively set for some
devices and not for others. For this reason, none of the Xkb library functions
involving DetectableAutoRepeat involve a device specifier.

.I XkbGetDetectableAutoRepeat
queries the server for the current state of DetectableAutoRepeat and waits for a
reply. If
.I supported_rtrn
is not NULL, it backfills
.I supported_rtrn
with True if the server supports DetectableAutoRepeat, and False otherwise.
.I XkbGetDetectableAutoRepeat
returns the current state of DetectableAutoRepeat for the requesting client:
True if DetectableAutoRepeat is set, and False otherwise.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
True
The
.I XkbGetDetectableAutoRepeat
function returns True if the server supports DetectableAutoRepeat.
.TP 15
False
The
.I XkbGetDetectableAutoRepeat
function returns False if the server does not support DetectableAutoRepeat.
