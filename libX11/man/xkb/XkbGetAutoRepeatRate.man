.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The core protocol allows only control over whether or not the entire keyboard or 
individual keys should auto-repeat when held down. RepeatKeys is a boolean 
control that extends this capability by adding control over the delay until a 
key begins to repeat and the rate at which it repeats. RepeatKeys is coupled 
with the core auto-repeat control: when RepeatKeys is enabled or disabled, the 
core auto-repeat is enabled or disabled and vice versa.

Auto-repeating keys are controlled by two attributes. The first, 
.I timeout, 
is the delay after the initial press of an auto-repeating key and the first 
generated repeat event. The second, 
.I interval, 
is the delay between all subsequent generated repeat events. As with all boolean 
controls, configuring the attributes that determine how the control operates 
does not automatically enable the control as a whole.

.I XkbGetAutoRepeatRate 
queries the server for the current values of the RepeatControls control 
attributes, backfills 
.I timeout_rtrn 
and 
.I interval_rtrn 
with them, and returns True. If a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not 
available in the server 
.I XkbGetAutoRepeatRate 
returns False.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
True
The XkbGetAutoRepeatRate function returns True if a compatible version of the 
Xkb extension is available in the server.
.TP 15
False
The XkbGetAutoRepeatRate function returns False if a compatible version of the 
Xkb extension is not available in the server.
