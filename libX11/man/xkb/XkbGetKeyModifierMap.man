.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The 
.I modmap 
entry of the client map is an array, indexed by keycode, specifying the real 
modifiers bound to a key. Each entry is a mask composed of a bitwise inclusive 
OR of the legal real modifiers: ShiftMask, LockMask, ControlMask, Mod1Mask, 
Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, and Mod5Mask. If a bit is set in a 
.I modmap 
entry, the corresponding key is bound to that modifier.

Pressing or releasing the key bound to a modifier changes the modifier set and 
unset state. The particular manner in which the modifier set and unset state 
changes is determined by the behavior and actions assigned to the key.

.I XkbGetKeyModifierMap 
sends a request to the server for the modifier mappings for 
.I num 
keys starting with the key whose keycode is 
.I first. 
It waits for a reply and places the results in the 
.I xkb->map->modmap 
array. If successful, 
.I XkbGetKeyModifier 
returns Success.
 
If the map component of the 
.I xkb 
parameter has not been allocated, 
.I XkbGetKeyModifierMap 
allocates and initializes it. 

If a compatible version of Xkb is not available in the server or the Xkb 
extension has not been properly initialized, 
.I XkbGetKeySyms 
returns BadAccess. If any allocation errors occur while obtaining the modifier 
map, 
.I XkbGetKeyModifierMap 
returns BadAlloc.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadAccess
The Xkb extension has not been properly initialized
.TP 15
.B BadAlloc
Unable to allocate storage
