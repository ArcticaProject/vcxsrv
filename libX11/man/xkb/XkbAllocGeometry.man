.SH NAME
XkbAllocGeometry \- Allocate an entire geometry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Status XkbAllocGeometry
.BI "(\^XkbDescPtr " "xkb" "\^,"
.BI "XkbGeometrySizesPtr " "sizes" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- xkb
keyboard description for which geometry is to be allocated
.TP
.I \- sizes
initial sizes for all geometry components
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a 
keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries. 
Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new element(s), and it 
is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation 
functions increase 
.I sz_* 
but never touch 
.I num_* 
(unless there is an allocation failure, in which case they reset both 
.I sz_* 
and 
.I num_* 
to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are 
not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not as expected.

.I XkbAllocGeometry 
allocates a keyboard geometry and adds it to the keyboard description specified 
by 
.I xkb. 
The keyboard description should be obtained via the 
.I XkbGetKeyboard 
or 
.I XkbAllocKeyboard 
functions. The 
.I sizes 
parameter specifies the number of elements to be reserved for the subcomponents 
of the keyboard geometry and can be zero or more. These subcomponents include 
the 
.I properties, colors, shapes, sections, and doodads. 

To free an entire geometry, use 
.I XkbFreeGeometry.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
