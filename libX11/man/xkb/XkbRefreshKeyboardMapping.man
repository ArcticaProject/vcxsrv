.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping 
is the Xkb equivalent of the core 
.I XRefreshKeyboardMapping 
function. It requests that the X server send the current key mapping information to 
this client. A client usually invokes 
.I XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping 
after receiving an XkbMapNotify event. 
.I XkbRefreshKeyboardMapping 
returns Success if it succeeds and BadMatch if the event is not an Xkb event.

The XkbMapNotify event can be generated when some client calls 
.I XkbSetMap, XkbChangeMap, XkbGetKeyboardByName, 
or any of the standard X library functions that change the keyboard mapping or modifier 
mapping.
