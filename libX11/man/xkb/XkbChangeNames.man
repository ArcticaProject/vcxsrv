.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbChangeNames 
provides a more flexible method for changing symbolic names than 
.I XkbSetNames 
and requires the use of an XkbNameChangesRec structure. 

.I XkbChangeNames 
copies any names specified by 
.I changes 
from the keyboard description, 
.I xkb, 
to the X server specified by 
.I dpy. XkbChangeNames 
aborts and returns False if any illegal type names or type shift level names are 
specified by changes.

To change the symbolic names in the server, first modify a local copy of the 
keyboard description and then use either 
.I XkbSetNames, 
or, to save network traffic, use a XkbNameChangesRec structure and call
.I XkbChangeNames 
to download the changes to the server. 
.I XkbSetNames 
and 
.I XkbChangeNames 
can generate BadAlloc, BadAtom, BadLength, BadMatch, and BadImplementation 
errors.
.SH STRUCTURES
.LP
The XkbNameChangesRec allows applications to identify small modifications to the 
symbolic names and 
effectively reduces the amount of traffic sent to the server:
.nf

    typedef struct _XkbNameChanges {
        unsigned int   changed;            /\(** name components that have changed 
*/
        unsigned char  first_type;         /\(** first key type with a new name */
        unsigned char  num_types;          /\(** number of types with new names */
        unsigned char  first_lvl;          /\(** first key type with new level 
names */
        unsigned char  num_lvls;           /\(** number of key types with new level 
names */
        unsigned char  num_aliases;        /\(** if key aliases changed, total 
number of key aliases */
        unsigned char  num_rg;             /\(** if radio groups changed, total 
number of radio groups */
        unsigned char  first_key;          /\(** first key with a new name */
        unsigned char  num_keys;           /\(** number of keys with new names */
        unsigned short changed_vmods;      /\(** mask of virtual modifiers for 
which names have changed */
        unsigned long  changed_indicators; /\(** mask of indicators for which names 
were changed */
        unsigned char  changed_groups;     /\(** mask of groups for which names 
were changed */
    } XkbNameChangesRec, *XkbNameChangesPtr
    
.fi    
The 
.I changed 
field specifies the name components that have changed and is the bitwise 
inclusive OR of the valid names 
mask bits defined in Table 1. The rest of the fields in the structure specify 
the ranges that have changed 
for the various kinds of symbolic names, as shown in Table 2.

Xkb provides several functions that work with symbolic names. Each of these 
functions uses a mask to 
specify individual fields of the structures described above. These masks and 
their relationships to the 
fields in a keyboard description are shown in Table 1.
