.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- display

.I \- values_for_bits
turns selected controls on (1) or off (0)
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbSetXlibControls 
modifies the state of the controls selected by 
.I bits_to_change; 
only the controls selected by 
.I bits_to_change 
are modified. If the bit corresponding to a control is on in 
.I bits_to_change 
and also on in 
.I values_for_bits, 
the control is enabled. If the bit corresponding to a control is on in
.I bits_to_change 
but off in 
.I values_for_bits, 
the control is disabled. 
.I bits_to_change 
should be an inclusive OR of bits from Table 1.
