.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Whenever a field in the controls structure changes in the server's keyboard description, the server sends an 
XkbControlsNotify event to all interested clients.To receive XkbControlsNotify events under all possible 
conditions, use
.I XkbSelectEvents 
and pass XkbControlsNotifyMask in both 
.I bits_to_change 
and 
.I values_for_bits.

To receive XkbControlsNotify events only under certain conditions, use
.I XkbSelectEventDetails 
using XkbControlsNotify as the 
.I event_type 
and specifying the desired state changes in 
.I bits_to_change 
and 
.I values_for_bits 
using mask bits from Table 1.

Table 1 shows the actual values for the individual mask bits used to select 
controls for 
modification and to enable and disable the control. Note that the same mask bit 
is used to 
specify general modifications to the parameters used to configure the control 
(which), and to 
enable and disable the control (enabled_ctrls). The anomalies in the table (no 
"ok" in column) 
are for controls that have no configurable attributes; and for controls that are 
not boolean 
controls and therefore cannot be enabled or disabled.

.TE

The 
.I changed_ctrls 
field specifies the controls components that have changed and consists of bits taken from the masks defined in 
Table 1 with "ok" in the 
.I changed_ctrls 
column.

The controls currently enabled in the server are reported in the 
.I enabled_ctrls 
field. If any controls were just enabled or disabled (that is, the contents of the 
.I enabled_ctrls 
field changed), they are flagged in the 
.I enabled_ctrl_changes 
field. The valid bits for these fields are the masks listed in Table 1 with "ok" in the 
.I enabled_ctrls 
column. The 
.I num_groups 
field reports the number of groups bound to the key belonging to the most number of groups and is automatically 
updated 
when the keyboard mapping changes.

If the change was caused by a request from a client, the 
.I keycode 
and 
.I event_type 
fields are set to zero and the 
.I req_major 
and 
.I req_minor 
fields identify the request. The 
.I req_major value is the same as the major extension opcode. Otherwise,
.I event_type 
is set to the type of event that caused the change (one of KeyPress, KeyRelease, DeviceKeyPress, 
DeviceKeyRelease, 
ButtonPress or ButtonRelease), and 
.I req_major 
and 
.I req_minor 
are undefined. If 
.I event_type 
is KeyPress, KeyRelease, DeviceKeyPress, or DeviceKeyRelease, the 
.I keycode 
field is set to the key that caused the change. If 
.I event_type 
is ButtonPress or ButtonRelease, 
.I keycode 
contains the button number. 

When a client receives an XkbControlsNotify event, it can note the changes in a changes structure using 
.I XkbNoteControlsChanges.

The 
.I wanted 
parameter is a bitwise inclusive OR of bits taken from the set of masks specified in Table 1 with "ok" in the 
.I changed_ctrls 
column. 
.I XkbNoteControlsChanges 
copies any changes reported in 
.I new 
and specified in 
.I wanted 
into the changes record specified by 
.I old.
