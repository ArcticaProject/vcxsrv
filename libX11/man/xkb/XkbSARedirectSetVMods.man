.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Actions associated with the XkbRedirectKeyAction structure generate KeyPress and KeyRelease events 
containing a keycode different from the key that was pressed or released.

The 
.I type 
field for the XkbRedirectKeyAction structure should always be XkbSA_RedirectKey.
Key presses cause a KeyPress event for the key specified by the 
.I new_key 
field instead of the actual key. The state reported in this event reports the current effective 
modifiers changed as follows: any real modifiers selected by the 
.I mods_mask 
field are set to corresponding values from the 
.I mods 
field. Any real modifiers bound to the virtual modifiers specified by the
.I vmods_mask0 
and 
.I vmods_mask1 
fields are either set or cleared, depending on the corresponding values in the
.I vmods0 
and 
.I vmods1 
fields. If the real and virtual modifier definitions specify conflicting values for a single modifier, 
the real modifier definition has priority.

Key releases cause a KeyRelease event for the key specified by the 
.I new_key 
field instead of the actual key. The state for this event consists of the effective keyboard modifiers 
at the time of the release, changed as described previously.

The XkbSA_RedirectKey action normally redirects to another key on the same device as the key that 
caused the event, unless that device does not belong to the input extension KeyClass, in which case 
this action causes an event on the core keyboard device. (The input extension categorizes devices by 
breaking them into classes. Keyboards, and other input devices with keys, are classified as KeyClass 
devices by the input extension.)

The 
.I vmods_mask0 
and 
.I vmods_mask1 
fields actually represent one 
.I vmods_mask 
value. Xkb provides macros to convert between the two formats.


.I XkbSARedirectSetVModsMask 
sets the 
.I vmods0 
and 
.I vmods1 
of 
.I act 
from 
.I v.
