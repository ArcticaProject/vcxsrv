.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- outline
outline in which points should be freed
.TP
.I \- first
first point to be freed
.TP
.I \- count
number of points to be freed
.TP
.I \- free_all
True => all points are freed 
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a 
keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries. 
Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new element(s), and it 
is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation 
functions increase 
.I sz_* 
but never touch 
.I num_* 
(unless there is an allocation failure, in which case they reset both 
.I sz_* 
and 
.I num_* 
to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are 
not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not as expected.

If 
.I free_all 
is True, all points are freed regardless of the value of 
>i first 
and 
.I count. 
Otherwise, the number of points specified by 
.I count 
are freed, beginning with the point specified by 
.I first 
in the specified outline.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
Success
The XkbFreeGeomPoints function returns Success when there are no allocation or 
argument errors.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadAlloc
Unable to allocate storage
.TP 15
.B BadValue
An argument is out of range
