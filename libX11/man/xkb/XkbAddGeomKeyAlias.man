real name to be bound to the new alias
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level keyboard 
geometry. In each case the 
.I num_ * 
fields of the corresponding structure is incremented by 1. These functions do 
not change 
.I sz_* 
unless there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the 
values of the element's structure from the arguments. For other functions, you 
must explicitly write code to fill the structure's elements.

The top-level geometry description includes a list of 
.I geometry properties. 
A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary 
name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use geometry properties as 
hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures refer 
to geometry properties.

.I XkbAddGeomKeyAlias 
adds one key alias with the value 
.I alias 
to the geometry 
.I geom, 
and associates it with the key whose real name is 
.I real. XkbAddGeomKeyAlias 
returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate 
space for the alias. To allocate space for an arbitrary number of aliases, use 
the 
.I XkbAllocGeomKeyAliases 
function.
