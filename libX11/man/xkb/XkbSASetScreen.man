.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Actions associated with the XkbSwitchScreen action structure change the active 
screen on a multiscreen display.

The 
.I type 
field of the XkbSwitchScreenAction structure should always be 
XkbSA_SwitchScreen.

The 
.I flags 
field is composed of the bitwise inclusive OR of the masks shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Switch Screen Action Flags
_
Flag	Meaning
_
XkbSA_SwitchAbsolute	T{
If set, the screenXXX field represents the index of the new screen. Otherwise, 
it represents an offset from the current screen to the new screen.
T}
XkbSA_SwitchApplication	T{
If not set, the action should switch to another screen on the same server. 
Otherwise, it should switch to another X server or application that shares the 
same physical display.
T}
.TE

The 
.I screenXXX 
field is a signed character value that represents either the relative or 
absolute screen index, depending on the state of the XkbSA_SwitchAbsolute bit in 
the 
.I flags 
field. Xkb provides the following macros to convert between the integer and 
signed character value for screen numbers in XkbSwitchScreenAction structures.
.SH STRUCTURES
.LP
.nf

    typedef struct _XkbSwitchScreenAction {
        unsigned char    type;        /\(** XkbSA_SwitchScreen */
        unsigned char    flags;       /\(** controls screen switching */
        char             screenXXX;   /\(** screen number or delta */
    } XkbSwitchScreenAction;

.fi
.SH NOTES
.LP
This action is optional. Servers are free to ignore the action or any of its 
flags if they do not support the requested behavior. If the action is ignored, 
it behaves like XkbSA_NoAction. Otherwise, key press and key release events do 
not generate an event.
