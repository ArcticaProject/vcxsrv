.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- dpy
connection to X server
.TP
.I \- first
keycode of first key of interest
.TP
.I \- num
number of keys desired
.TP
.I \- xkb
pointer to keyboard description where result is stored
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbGetKeyActions 
sends a request to the server to obtain the actions for 
.I num 
keys on the keyboard starting with key 
.I first. 
It waits for a reply and returns the actions in the 
.I server->key_acts 
field of 
.I xkb. 
If successful, 
.I XkbGetKeyActions 
returns Success. The 
.I xkb 
parameter must be a pointer to a valid Xkb keyboard description.

If the 
.I server 
map, in the 
.I xkb 
parameter, has not been allocated, 
.I XkbGetKeyActions 
allocates and initializes it before obtaining the actions.

If the server does not have a compatible version of Xkb, or the Xkb extension 
has not been properly initialized, 
.I XkbGetKeyActions 
returns BadAccess. If 
.I num 
is less than 1 or greater than XkbMaxKeyCount, 
.I XkbGetKeyActions 
returns BadValue. If any allocation errors occur, 
.I XkbGetKeyActions 
returns BadAlloc. 
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
