.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The core protocol does not provide any means to prevent a modifier from being 
reported in events sent to clients; Xkb, however makes this possible via the 
InternalMods control. It specifies modifiers that should be consumed by the 
server and not reported to clients. When a key is pressed and a modifier that 
has its bit set in the InternalMods control is reported to the server, the 
server uses the modifier when determining the actions to apply for the key. The 
server then clears the bit, so it is not actually reported to the client. In 
addition, modifiers specified in the InternalMods control are not used to 
determine grabs and are not used to calculate core protocol compatibility state.

Manipulate the InternalMods control via the 
.I internal 
field in the XkbControlsRec structure, using 
.I XkbSetControls 
and 
.I XkbGetControls. 
Alternatively, use 
.I XkbSetServerInternalMods.

.I XkbSetServerInternalMods 
sends a request to the server to change the internal modifiers consumed by the 
server. 
.I affect_real 
and 
.I real_values 
are masks of real modifier bits indicating which real modifiers are to be added 
and removed from the server's internal modifiers control. Modifiers selected by 
both 
.I affect_real 
and 
.I real_values 
are added to the server's internal modifiers control; those selected by
.I affect_real 
but not by 
.I real_values 
are removed from the server's internal modifiers mask. Valid values for
.I affect_real 
and 
.I real_values 
consist of any combination of the eight core modifier bits: ShiftMask, LockMask, 
ControlMask, Mod1Mask - Mod5Mask. 
.I affect_virtual 
and 
.I virtual_values 
are masks of virtual modifier bits indicating which virtual modifiers are to be 
added and removed from the server's internal modifiers control. Modifiers 
selected by both 
.I affect_virtual 
and 
.I virtual_values 
are added to the server's internal modifiers control; those selected by
.I affect_virtual 
but not by 
.I virtual_values 
are removed from the server's internal modifiers control. See below for a 
discussion of virtual modifier masks to use in 
.I affect_virtual 
and 
.I virtual_values. XkbSetServerInternalMods 
does not wait for a reply from the server. It returns True if the request was 
sent and False otherwise.

Virtual modifiers are named by converting their string name to an X Atom and 
storing the Atom in the 
.I names.vmods 
array in an XkbDescRec structure. The position of a name Atom in the 
.I names.vmods 
array defines the bit position used to represent the virtual modifier and also 
the index used when accessing virtual modifier information in arrays: the name 
in the i-th (0 relative) entry of 
.I names.vmods 
is the i-th virtual modifier, represented by the mask (1<<i). Throughout Xkb, 
various functions have a parameter that is a mask representing virtual modifier 
choices. In each case, the i-th bit (0 relative) of the mask represents the i-th 
virtual modifier.

To set the name of a virtual modifier, use 
.I XkbSetNames, 
using XkbVirtualModNamesMask in 
.I which 
and the name in the 
.I xkb 
argument; to retrieve indicator names, use 
.I XkbGetNames.
.SH STRUCTURES
.LP
The complete description of an Xkb keyboard is given by an XkbDescRec. The 
component structures in the XkbDescRec represent the major Xkb components 
outlined in Figure 1.1.

The display field points to an X display structure. The flags field is private 
to the library: modifying flags may yield unpredictable results. The device_spec 
field specifies the device identifier of the keyboard input device, or 
XkbUseCoreKeyboard, which specifies the core keyboard device. The min_key_code 
and max_key_code fields specify the least and greatest keycode that can be 
returned by the keyboard.
 
Each structure component has a corresponding mask bit that is used in function 
calls to indicate that the structure should be manipulated in some manner, such 
as allocating it or freeing it. These masks and their relationships to the 
fields in the XkbDescRec are shown in Table 1.
