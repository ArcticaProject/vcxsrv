.TH XkbGetStickyKeysOptions __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbGetStickyKeysOptions \- Queries the current StickyKeys attributes for a keyboard device
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Bool XkbGetStickyKeysOptions
.BI "(\^Display *" "display" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "device_spec" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int *" "options_rtrn" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- display
connection to X server
.TP
.I \- device_spec
device ID, or XkbUseCoreKbd
.TP
.I \- options_rtrn
backfilled with StickyKeys option mask
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
The StickyKeys control has two options that can be accessed via the 
.I ax_options 
of an XkbControlsRec structure. The first option, TwoKeys, specifies whether StickyKeys should 
automatically turn off when two keys are pressed at the same time. This feature is useful for 
shared computers so people who do not want them do not need to turn StickyKeys off if a previous 
user left StickyKeys on. The second option, LatchToLock, specifies whether or not StickyKeys 
locks a modifier when pressed twice in a row.

.I XkbGetStickyKeysOptions 
requests the attributes of the StickyKeys control from the server, waits for a reply, and 
backfills 
.I options_rtrn 
with a mask indicating whether the individual StickyKeys options are on or off. Valid bits in 
.I options_rtrn 
are:
.nf

     XkbAX_TwoKeysMask
     XkbAX_LatchToLockMask
     
.fi     
.I XkbGetStickyKeysOptions 
returns True if successful; if a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not available in the 
server 
.I XkbGetStickyKeysOptions 
returns False.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
True
The 
.I XkbGetStickyKeysOptions 
function returns True if the request for the attributes of the StickyKeys control from the 
server was successful.
.TP 15
False
The 
.I XkbGetStickyKeysOptions 
function returns False if a compatible version of the Xkb extension is not available in the 
server. 
.SH STRUCTURES
