.SH NAME
XkbAllocGeomRows \- Allocate rows in a section
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B Status XkbAllocGeomRows
.BI "(\^XkbSectionPtr " "section" "\^,"
.BI "int " "num_needed" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- section
section for which rows should be allocated
.TP
.I \- num_needed
number of new rows required
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a 
keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries. 
Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new element(s), and it 
is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation 
functions increase 
.I sz_* 
but never touch 
.I num_* 
(unless there is an allocation failure, in which case they reset both 
.I sz_* 
and 
.I num_* 
to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are 
not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not as expected.

.I XkbAllocGeomRows 
allocates 
.I num_needed 
rows and adds them to the 
.I section. 
No initialization of the rows is done.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadAlloc
Unable to allocate storage
.TP 15
.B BadValue
An argument is out of range
