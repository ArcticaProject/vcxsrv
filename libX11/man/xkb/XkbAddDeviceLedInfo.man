.TH XkbAddDeviceLedInfo __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbAddDeviceLedInfo \- Initialize an XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B XkbDeviceLedInfoPtr XkbAddDeviceLedInfo
.BI "(\^XkbDeviceInfoPtr " "device_info" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "led_class" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "led_id" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- device_info
structure in which to add LED info
.TP
.I \- led_class
input extension class for LED device of interest
.TP
.I \- led_id
input extension ID for LED device of interest
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbAddDeviceLedInfo 
first checks to see whether an entry matching 
.I led_class 
and 
.I led_id 
already exists in the 
.I device_info->leds 
array. If it finds a matching entry, it returns a pointer to that entry. Otherwise, it checks to be sure 
there is at least one empty entry in
.I device_info->leds 
and extends it if there is not enough room. It then increments
.I device_info->num_leds 
and fills in the next available entry in 
.I device_info->leds 
with 
.I led_class 
and 
.I led_id.

If successful, 
.I XkbAddDeviceLedInfo 
returns a pointer to the XkbDeviceLedInfoRec structure that was initialized. If unable to allocate 
sufficient storage, or if 
.I device_info 
points to an invalid XkbDeviceInfoRec structure, or if 
.I led_class 
or 
.I led_id 
are inappropriate, 
.I XkbAddDeviceLedInfo 
returns NULL.

To allocate additional space for button actions in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure, use 
.I XkbResizeDeviceButtonActions.

Information about X Input Extension devices is transferred between a client program and the Xkb 
extension in an XkbDeviceInfoRec structure:
