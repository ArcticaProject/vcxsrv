.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Actions associated with the XkbCtrlsAction structure change the state of the 
boolean controls.

The 
.I type 
field can have any one of the values shown in Table 1.

Table 1 Controls Action Types
_
Type	Effect
_
XkbSA_SetControls	T{
A key press enables any boolean controls specified in the ctrls fields that were 
not already enabled at 
the time of the key press.
A key release disables any controls enabled by the key press.
This action can cause XkbControlsNotify events.
T}
XkbSA_LockControls	T{
If the XkbSA_LockNoLock bit is not set in the flags field, a key press enables 
any controls specified in 
the ctrls fields that were not already enabled at the time of the key press.
.br
If the XkbSA_LockNoUnlock bit is not set in the flags field, a key release 
disables any controls 
specified in the ctrls fields that were not already disabled at the time of the 
key press.

This action can cause XkbControlsNotify events.

The 
.I flags 
field is composed of the bitwise inclusive OR of the masks shown in Table 2.

XkbSA_LockNoLock	T{

If set, and the action type is XkbSA_LockControls, the server only enables

The XkbSA_SetControls action implements a key that enables a boolean control 
when pressed and disables it 
when released. The XkbSA_LockControls action is used to implement a key that 
toggles the state of a 
boolean control each time it is pressed and released. The XkbSA_LockNoLock and 
XkbSA_LockNoUnlock flags 
allow modifying the toggling behavior to only unlock or only lock the boolean 
control.

The 
.I ctrls0, ctrls1, ctrls2, 
and 
.I ctrls3 
fields represent the boolean controls in the 
.I enabled_ctrls 
field of the controls structure. Xkb macros, to convert between the two formats.

.I XkbActionCtrls 
returns the 
.I ctrls 
fields of 
.I act 
converted to an unsigned int.
