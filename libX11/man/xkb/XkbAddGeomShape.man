name of the new shape

.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level keyboard geometry. In each case the 
.I num_ * 
fields of the corresponding structure is incremented by 1. These functions do not change 
.I sz_* 
unless there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the values of the element's structure from the 
arguments. For other functions, you must explicitly write code to fill the structure's elements.

The top-level geometry description includes a list of 
.I geometry properties. 
A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary name. Programs that display images of 
keyboards can use geometry properties as hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures refer to 
geometry properties.

A geometry contains an arbitrary number of shapes, each of which is made up of an arbitrary number of outlines.
.I XkbAddGeomShape 
adds a shape to a geometry 
.I geom 
by allocating space for 
.I sz_outlines 
outlines for it and giving it the name specified by 
.I name. 
If a shape with name 
.I name 
already exists in the geometry, a pointer to the existing shape is returned. 
.I XkbAddGeomShape 
returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate space. To allocate space for an arbitrary 
number of geometry shapes, use 
.I XkbAllocGeomShapes.
