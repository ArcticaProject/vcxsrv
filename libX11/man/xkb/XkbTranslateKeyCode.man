.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- xkb
keyboard description to use for translation
.TP
.I \- key
keycode to translate
.TP
.I \- mods
modifiers to apply when translating key
.TP
.I \- mods_rtrn
backfilled with consumed modifiers
.TP
.I \- keysym_rtrn
keysym resulting from translation
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I mods_rtrn 
is backfilled with the modifiers consumed by the translation process. 
.I mods 
is a bitwise inclusive OR of the legal modifier masks: ShiftMask, LockMask, 
ControlMask, Mod1Mask, Mod2Mask, Mod3Mask, Mod4Mask, Mod5Mask.The 
AlwaysConsumeShiftAndLock library control (see below), if enabled, causes
.I XkbTranslateKeyCode 
to consume shift and lock. 
.I XkbTranslateKeyCode 
returns True if the translation resulted in a keysym, and False if it resulted 
in NoSymbol.

The AlwaysConsumeShiftAndLock control, if enabled, forces 
.I XLookupString 
to consume the Shift and Lock modifiers when processing all keys, even if the 
definition for the key type does not specify these modifiers. The 
AlwaysConsumeShiftAndLock control is unset by default.
