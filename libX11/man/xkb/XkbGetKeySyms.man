.I \- dpy
connection to X server

.I \- num
number of keycodes for which syms desired 
.TP
.I \- xkb
Xkb description to be updated
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I XkbGetKeySyms 
sends a request to the server to obtain the set of keysyms bound to 
.I num 
keys starting with the key whose keycode is 
.I first. 
It waits for a reply and returns the keysyms in the 
.I map.syms 
field of 
.I xkb. 
If successful, 
.I XkbGetKeySyms 
returns Success. The 
.I xkb 
parameter must be a pointer to a valid Xkb keyboard description.

If the client 
.I map 
in the xkb parameter has not been allocated, 
.I XkbGetKeySyms 
allocates and initializes it before obtaining the symbols. 

If a compatible version of Xkb is not available in the server or the Xkb 
extension has not been properly initialized, 
.I XkbGetKeySyms 
returns BadAccess. If 
.I num 
is less than 1 or greater than XkbMaxKeyCount, 
.I XkbGetKeySyms 
returns BadValue. If any allocation errors occur, 
.I XkbGetKeySyms 
returns BadAlloc.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
Success
The 
.I XkbGetKeySyms 
function returns Success if it gets a reply to a request to the server to obtain the set of keysyms bound to
