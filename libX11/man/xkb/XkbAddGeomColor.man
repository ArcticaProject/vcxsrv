.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb provides functions to add a single new element to the top-level keyboard 
geometry. In each case the 
.I num_ * 
fields of the corresponding structure is incremented by 1. These functions do 
not change 
.I sz_* 
unless there is no more room in the array. Some of these functions fill in the 
values of the element's structure from the arguments. For other functions, you 
must explicitly write code to fill the structure's elements.

The top-level geometry description includes a list of 
.I geometry properties. 
A geometry property associates an arbitrary string with an equally arbitrary 
name. Programs that display images of keyboards can use geometry properties as 
hints, but they are not interpreted by Xkb. No other geometry structures refer 
to geometry properties.

.I XkbAddGeomColor 
adds the specified color 
.I name 
and 
.I pixel 
to the specified geometry 
.I geom. 
The top-level geometry description includes a list of up to MaxColors (32) 
.I color names. 
A color 
.I name 
is a string whose interpretation is not specified by Xkb and neither is the
.I pixel 
value's interpretation. All other geometry data structures refer to colors using 
their indices in this global list or pointers to colors in this list.
.I XkbAddGeomColor 
returns NULL if any of the parameters is empty or if it was not able to allocate 
space for the color. To allocate space for an arbitrary number of colors to a 
geometry, use the 
.I XkbAllocGeomColors 
function.
