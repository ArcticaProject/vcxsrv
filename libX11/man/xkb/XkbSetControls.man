.TH XkbSetControls __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbSetControls \- Copies changes to the X server based on a modified ctrls 
structure in a local copy of the keyboard description
.SH SYNOPSIS

.BI "(\^Display *" "display" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned long " "which" "\^,"
.BI "XkbDescPtr " "xkb" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- display
connection to X server
.TP
.I \- which
mask of controls requested
.TP
.I \- xkb
keyboard description for controls information
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
For each bit that is set in the 
.I which 
parameter, 
.I XkbSetControls 
sends the corresponding values from the 
.I xkb->ctrls 
field to the server. Valid values for 
.I which 
are any combination of the masks listed in Table 1 that have "ok" in the
.I which 
column.

Table 1 shows the actual values for the individual mask bits used to select 
controls for 
modification and to enable and disable the control. Note that the same mask bit 
is used to 
specify general modifications to the parameters used to configure the control 
(which), and to 
enable and disable the control (enabled_ctrls). The anomalies in the table (no 
"ok" in column) 
are for controls that have no configurable attributes; and for controls that are 
not boolean 
controls and therefore cannot be enabled or disabled.

.TE

If 
.I xkb->ctrls 
is NULL, the server does not support a compatible version of Xkb, or the Xkb 
extension has not been properly initialized, 
.I XkbSetControls 
returns False. Otherwise, it sends the request to the X server and returns True.

Note that changes to attributes of controls in the XkbControlsRec structure are 
apparent only when the associated control is enabled, although the corresponding 
values are still updated in the X server. For example, the 
.I repeat_delay 
and 
.I repeat_interval 
fields are ignored unless the RepeatKeys control is enabled (that is, the X 
server's equivalent of 
.I xkb->ctrls 
has XkbRepeatKeyMask set in 
.I enabled_ctrls). 
It is permissible to modify the attributes of a control in one call to
.I XkbSetControls 
and enable the control in a subsequent call. See 
.I XkbChangeEnabledControls 
for more information on enabling and disabling controls.

Note that the 
.I enabled_ctrls 
field is itself a control - the EnabledControls control. As such, to set a 
specific configuration of enabled and disabled boolean controls, you must set
.I enabled_ctrls 
to the appropriate bits to enable only the controls you want and disable all 
others, then specify the XkbControlsEnabledMask in a call to 
.I XkbSetControls. 

Because this is somewhat awkward if all you want to do is enable and disable 
controls, and not modify any of their attributes, a convenience function is also 
provided for this purpose, 
.I XkbChangeEnabledControls.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.TP 15
True
The 
.I XkbSetControls 
function returns True when it sends the request to the X server.
.TP 15
False
The 
.I XkbSetControls 
function returns False when 
.I xkb->ctrls 
is NULL, the server does not support a compatible version of Xkb, or the Xkb 
extension has not been properly initialized.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadAlloc
Unable to allocate storage
.TP 15
.B BadMatch
A compatible version of Xkb was not available in the server or an argument has 
correct type and range, but is otherwise invalid
