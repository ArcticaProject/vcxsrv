.TH XkbFreeGeometry __libmansuffix__ __xorgversion__ "XKB FUNCTIONS"
.SH NAME
XkbFreeGeometry \- Free an entire geometry
.SH SYNOPSIS
.HP
.B void XkbFreeGeometry
.BI "(\^XkbGeometryPtr " "geom" "\^,"
.BI "unsigned int " "which" "\^,"
.BI "Bool " "free_all" "\^);"
.if n .ti +5n
.if t .ti +.5i
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
.I \- geom
geometry to be freed
.TP
.I \- which
mask of geometry components to be freed 
.TP
.I \- free_all
True => the entire geometry is freed
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
Xkb provides a number of functions to allocate and free subcomponents of a 
keyboard geometry. Use these functions to create or modify keyboard geometries. 
Note that these functions merely allocate space for the new element(s), and it 
is up to you to fill in the values explicitly in your code. These allocation 
functions increase 
.I sz_* 
but never touch 
.I num_* 
(unless there is an allocation failure, in which case they reset both 
.I sz_* 
and 
.I num_* 
to zero). These functions return Success if they succeed, BadAlloc if they are 
not able to allocate space, or BadValue if a parameter is not as expected.

The values of 
.I which 
and 
.I free_all 
determine how much of the specified geometry is freed. The valid values for
.I which 
are:

.nf
    #define   XkbGeomPropertiesMask      (1<<0)
    #define   XkbGeomColorsMask          (1<<1)
    #define   XkbGeomShapesMask          (1<<2)
    #define   XkbGeomSectionsMask        (1<<3)
    #define   XkbGeomDoodadsMask         (1<<4)
    #define   XkbGeomKeyAliasesMask      (1<<5)
    #define   XkbGeomAllMask             (0x3f)
    
.fi    
If 
.I free_all 
is True, the entire geometry is freed regardless of the value of 
.I which. 
Otherwise, the portions of the geometry specified by 
.I which 
are freed.
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 15
.B BadAlloc
Unable to allocate storage
.TP 15
.B BadValue
An argument is out of range
