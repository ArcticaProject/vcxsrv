.SH NAME
XMapRequestEvent \- MapRequest event structure
.SH STRUCTURES
The structure for
.ZN MapRequest
events contains:
.LP
.Ds 0
.TA .5i 3i
.ta .5i 3i
typedef struct {
	int type;	/\&* MapRequest */
	unsigned long serial;	/\&* # of last request processed by server */
	Bool send_event;	/\&* true if this came from a SendEvent request */
	Display *display;	/\&* Display the event was read from */
	Window parent;
	Window window;
} XMapRequestEvent;
.De
.LP
When you receive this event,
the structure members are set as follows.
.LP
The type member is set to the event type constant name that uniquely identifies
it.
For example, when the X server reports a
.ZN GraphicsExpose
event to a client application, it sends an
.ZN XGraphicsExposeEvent
structure with the type member set to
.ZN GraphicsExpose .
The display member is set to a pointer to the display the event was read on.
The send_event member is set to
.ZN True
if the event came from a
.ZN SendEvent
protocol request.
The serial member is set from the serial number reported in the protocol
but expanded from the 16-bit least-significant bits to a full 32-bit value.
The window member is set to the window that is most useful to toolkit
dispatchers.
.LP
The parent member is set to the parent window.
The window member is set to the window to be mapped.
