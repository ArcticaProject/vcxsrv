@@@ Each unique machine architecture needs an entry in this file
@@@ If fc-arch runs and doesn't find a matching entry, it will print
@@@ out the archtecture signature in the error message. Take that
@@@ signature and place it in this file along with a suitable architecture
@@@ name. Architecture names are used to construct file names, so
@@@ use something reasonable and don't include any spaces

@@@ So far the differences boil down to: endianness, 32 vs 64 bit pointers,
@@@ and on @@@ 32bit ones, whether double is aligned to one word or two words.
@@@ Those result in the 6 formats listed below.
