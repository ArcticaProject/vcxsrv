Loads the default configuration file and returns the resulting configuration.

Loads the default configuration file and builds information about the
available fonts.  Returns the resulting configuration.

@FUNC@          FcInit 
@TYPE1@		void
@PURPOSE@	initialize fontconfig library
@DESC@
Loads the default configuration file and the fonts referenced therein and
sets the default configuration to that result.  Returns whether this
process succeeded or not.  If the default configuration has already
been loaded, this routine does nothing and returns FcTrue.

@FUNC@		FcFini
@TYPE1@		void
@PURPOSE@	finalize fontconfig library
@DESC@
Frees all data structures allocated by previous calls to fontconfig
functions. Fontconfig returns to an uninitialized state, requiring a
new call to one of the FcInit functions before any other fontconfig
function may be called.

Returns the version number of the library.

@TYPE1@		void
@PURPOSE@	re-initialize library
@DESC@
Forces the default configuration file to be reloaded and resets the default
configuration. Returns FcFalse if the configuration cannot be reloaded (due
to configuration file errors, allocation failures or other issues) and leaves the
existing configuration unchanged. Otherwise returns FcTrue.

@FUNC@          FcInitBringUptoDate 
@TYPE1@		void
@PURPOSE@	reload configuration files if needed
@DESC@
Checks the rescan interval in the default configuration, checking the
configuration if the interval has passed and reloading the configuration if
when any changes are detected. Returns FcFalse if the configuration cannot
be reloaded (see FcInitReinitialize). Otherwise returns FcTrue.
