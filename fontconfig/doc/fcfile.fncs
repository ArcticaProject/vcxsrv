@PURPOSE@	scan a font file
@DESC@
Scans a single file and adds all fonts found to <parameter>set</parameter>.
If <parameter>force</parameter> is FcTrue, then the file is scanned even if
associated information is found in <parameter>cache</parameter>.  If
<parameter>file</parameter> is a directory, it is added to
<parameter>dirs</parameter>. Whether fonts are found depends on fontconfig
policy as well as the current configuration. Internally, fontconfig will
ignore BDF and PCF fonts which are not in Unicode (or the effectively
equivalent ISO Latin-1) encoding as those are not usable by Unicode-based
applications. The configuration can ignore fonts based on filename or
contents of the font file itself. Returns FcFalse if any of the fonts cannot be
added (due to allocation failure). Otherwise returns FcTrue.

@PURPOSE@	scan a font directory without caching it
@DESC@
If <parameter>cache</parameter> is not zero or if <parameter>force</parameter>
is FcFalse, this function currently returns FcFalse.  Otherwise, it scans an
entire directory and adds all fonts found to <parameter>set</parameter>.
Any subdirectories found are added to <parameter>dirs</parameter>.  Calling
this function does not create any cache files.  Use FcDirCacheRead() if
caching is desired.

@PURPOSE@	DEPRECATED: formerly used to save a directory cache
@DESC@
This function now does nothing aside from returning FcFalse. It used to creates the
per-directory cache file for <parameter>dir</parameter> and populates it
with the fonts in <parameter>set</parameter> and subdirectories in
<parameter>dirs</parameter>. All of this functionality is now automatically
managed by FcDirCacheLoad and FcDirCacheRead.
