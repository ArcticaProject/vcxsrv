@PURPOSE@	create an FcAtomic object
@DESC@
Creates a data structure containing data needed to control access to <parameter>file</parameter>.
Writing is done to a separate file.  Once that file is complete, the original
configuration file is atomically replaced so that reading process always see
a consistent and complete file without the need to lock for reading.
