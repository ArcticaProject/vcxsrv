# We amend the main alphabet with tone marks over each vowel, but some
# combinations lack precomposed forms in Unicode, so we also add indiviual
# combining marks.
#
# Sources also differ on the notation used for the fourth tone: circumflex
# vs combining line above (U+030D). At the moment, we are not including any
# of the two.
#
# There is also a nasalization mark for vowels (combining tilde), but there
# is a need for more research to find which vowels it's used with. The
# combination of nasalization and tones may also exist, resulting in double
# accents.
#
# C, J, and Q are not used.
