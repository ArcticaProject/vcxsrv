# The orthography from evertype.com includes the lenited consonants
# as indicated with seimhiu (dot above). I've included those here
# even though they're not present in the orthography listed from eki.ee;
# eki.ee mentions that the seimhiu form is still written but is
# often written by a following h instead.
