/** Represents an intrinsic
 *
 * An intrinsic is an instruction type for handling things that are
 * more-or-less regular operations but don't just consume and produce SSA
 * values like ALU operations do.  Intrinsics are not for things that have
 * special semantic meaning such as phi nodes and parallel copies.
 * Examples of intrinsics include variable load/store operations, system
 * value loads, and the like.  Even though texturing more-or-less falls
 * under this category, texturing is its own instruction type because
 * trying to represent texturing with intrinsics would lead to a
 * combinatorial explosion of intrinsic opcodes.
 *
 * By having a single instruction type for handling a lot of different
 * cases, optimization passes can look for intrinsics and, for the most

 * eliminated.  That way passes like dead code elimination can still work
 * on intrisics without understanding the meaning of each.
 *
 * Each intrinsic has some number of constant indices, some number of
 * variables, and some number of sources.  What these sources, variables,
 * and indices mean depends on the intrinsic and is documented with the
 * intrinsic declaration in nir_intrinsics.h.  Intrinsics and texture
