/**
 * This header file defines all the available intrinsics in one place. It
 * expands to a list of macros of the form:
 *
 * INTRINSIC(name, num_srcs, src_components, has_dest, dest_components,
 *              num_variables, num_indices, flags)
 *
 * Which should correspond one-to-one with the nir_intrinsic_info structure. It
 * is included in both ir.h to create the nir_intrinsic enum (with members of
 * the form nir_intrinsic_(name)) and and in opcodes.c to create
 * nir_intrinsic_infos, which is a const array of nir_intrinsic_info structures
 * for each intrinsic.

 * register input, which is added to the constant address to compute the
 * final address to load from.  For UBO's (and SSBO's), the first source is
 * the (possibly constant) UBO buffer index and the indirect (if it exists)
 * is the second source.
 *
 * For vector backends, the address is in terms of one vec4, and so each array
 * element is +4 scalar components from the previous array element. For scalar
 * backends, the address is in terms of a single 4-byte float/int and arrays
 * elements begin immediately after the previous array element.
