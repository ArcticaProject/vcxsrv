/*
 * This is a pass for removing phi nodes that look like:
 * a = phi(b, b, b, ...)
 *
 * Note that we can't ignore undef sources here, or else we may create a
 * situation where the definition of b isn't dominated by its uses. We're
 * allowed to do this since the definition of b must dominate all of the
 * phi node's predecessors, which means it must dominate the phi node as well
 * as all of the phi node's uses. In essence, the phi node acts as a copy
 * instruction. b can't be another phi node in the same block, since the only
 * time when phi nodes can source other phi nodes defined in the same block is
 * at the loop header, and in that case one of the sources of the phi has to
 * be from before the loop and that source can't be b.
