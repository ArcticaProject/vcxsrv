/*
 * Implements "copy splitting" which is similar to structure splitting only
 * it works on copy operations rather than the datatypes themselves.  The
 * GLSL language allows you to copy one variable to another an entire
 * structure (which may contain arrays or other structures) at a time.
 * Normally, in a language such as C this would be handled by a "structure
 * splitting" pass that breaks up the structures.  Unfortunately for us,
 * structures used in inputs or outputs can't be split.  Therefore,
 * regardlesss of what we do, we have to be able to copy to/from
 * structures.
 *
 * The primary purpose of structure splitting is to allow you to better
 * optimize variable access and lower things to registers where you can.
 * The primary issue here is that, if you lower the copy to a bunch of
 * loads and stores, you loose a lot of information about the copy
 * operation that you would like to keep around.  To solve this problem, we
 * have a "copy splitting" pass that, instead of splitting the structures
 * or lowering the copy into loads and storres, splits the copy operation
 * into a bunch of copy operations one for each leaf of the structure tree.
 * If an intermediate array is encountered, it is referenced with a
 * wildcard reference to indicate that the entire array is to be copied.
 *
 * As things become direct, array copies may be able to be losslessly
 * lowered to having fewer and fewer wildcards.  However, until that
 * happens we want to keep the information about the arrays intact.
 *
 * Prior to the copy splitting pass, there are no wildcard references but
 * there may be incomplete references where the tail of the deref chain is
 * an array or a structure and not a specific element.  After the copy
 * splitting pass has completed, every variable deref will be a full-length
 * dereference pointing to a single leaf in the structure type tree with
 * possibly a few wildcard array dereferences.
