/**
 * \file lower_const_arrays_to_uniforms.cpp
 *
 * Lower constant arrays to uniform arrays.
 *
 * Some driver backends (such as i965 and nouveau) don't handle constant arrays
 * gracefully, instead treating them as ordinary writable temporary arrays.
 * Since arrays can be large, this often means spilling them to scratch memory,
 * which usually involves a large number of instructions.
 *
 * This must be called prior to link_set_uniform_initializers(); we need the
 * linker to process our new uniform's constant initializer.
 *
 * This should be called after optimizations, since those can result in
 * splitting and removing arrays that are indexed by constant expressions.
