/**
 * \file ir_sub_to_add_neg.cpp
 *
 * Breaks an ir_binop_sub expression down to add(op0, neg(op1))
 *
 * This simplifies expression reassociation, and for many backends
 * there is no subtract operation separate from adding the negation.
 * For backends with native subtract operations, they will probably
 * want to recognize add(op0, neg(op1)) or the other way around to
 * produce a subtract anyway.
