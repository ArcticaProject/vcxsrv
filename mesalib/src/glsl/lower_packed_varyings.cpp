/**
 * \file lower_varyings_to_packed.cpp
 *
 * This lowering pass generates GLSL code that manually packs varyings into
 * vec4 slots, for the benefit of back-ends that don't support packed varyings
 * natively.
 *
 * For example, the following shader:
 *
 *   out mat3x2 foo;  // location=4, location_frac=0
 *   out vec3 bar[2]; // location=5, location_frac=2
 *
 *   main()
 *   {
 *     ...
 *   }
 *
 * Is rewritten to:
 *
 *   mat3x2 foo;
 *   vec3 bar[2];
 *   out vec4 packed4; // location=4, location_frac=0
 *   out vec4 packed5; // location=5, location_frac=0
 *   out vec4 packed6; // location=6, location_frac=0
 *
 *   main()
 *   {
 *     ...
 *     packed4.xy = foo[0];
 *     packed4.zw = foo[1];
 *     packed5.xy = foo[2];
 *     packed5.zw = bar[0].xy;
 *     packed6.x = bar[0].z;
 *     packed6.yzw = bar[1];
 *   }
 *
 * This lowering pass properly handles "double parking" of a varying vector
 * across two varying slots.  For example, in the code above, two of the
 * components of bar[0] are stored in packed5, and the remaining component is
 * stored in packed6.
 *
 * Note that in theory, the extra instructions may cause some loss of
 * performance.  However, hopefully in most cases the performance loss will
 * either be absorbed by a later optimization pass, or it will be offset by
 * memory bandwidth savings (because fewer varyings are used).
 *
 * This lowering pass also packs flat floats, ints, and uints together, by
 * using ivec4 as the base type of flat "varyings", and using appropriate
 * casts to convert floats and uints into ints.
 *
 * This lowering pass also handles varyings whose type is a struct or an array
 * of struct.  Structs are packed in order and with no gaps, so there may be a
 * performance penalty due to structure elements being double-parked.
