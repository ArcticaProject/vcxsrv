    * Create a buffer that wraps user-space data.

    * or perhaps never.  Basically the allocate/upload is delayed
    * until the buffer is actually passed to hardware.

    * into a buffer, and secondly to avoid a copy operation if that
    * data subsequently turns out to be only accessed by the CPU.
    *
    * Common example is OpenGL vertex buffers that are subsequently
    * processed either by software TNL in the driver or by passing to
    * hardware.

    * XXX: What happens if the delayed call to buffer_create() fails?

    * buffer is destroyed, so the data must not be freed before then.
