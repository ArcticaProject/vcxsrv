/**
 * @file
 * Simple slab allocator for equally sized memory allocations.
 * util_slab_alloc and util_slab_free have time complexity in O(1).
 *
 * Good for allocations which have very low lifetime and are allocated
 * and freed very often. Use a profiler first to know if it's worth using it!
 *
 * Candidates: get_transfer
