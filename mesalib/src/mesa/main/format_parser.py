    * SWIZZLE_ZERO: The numeric constant 0
    * SWIZZLE_ONE: THe numeric constant 1
    * SWIZZLE_NONE: No data available for this channel

   Sometimes a Swizzle is represented by a 4-character string.  In this
   case, the source channels are represented by the characters "x", "y",
   "z", and "w"; the numeric constants are represented as "0" and "1"; and
   no mapping is represented by "_".  For instance, the map from
   luminance-alpha to rgba is given by "xxxy" because each of the three rgb
   channels maps to the first luminance-alpha channel and the alpha channel
   maps to second luminance-alpha channel.  The mapping from bgr to rgba is
