<h1>Bug Database</h1>

<p>
The Mesa bug database is hosted on
<a href="http://freedesktop.org" target="_parent">freedesktop.org</a>.
The old bug database on SourceForge is no longer used.
</p>

<p>
To file a Mesa bug, go to
<a href="https://bugs.freedesktop.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=Mesa"
target="_parent">
Bugzilla on freedesktop.org</a>
</p>

<p>
Please follow these bug reporting guidelines:
</p>

<ul>
<li>Check if a new version of Mesa is available which might have fixed
the problem.
<li>Check if your bug is already reported in the database.
<li>Monitor your bug report for requests for additional information, etc.
<li>If you're reporting a crash, try to use your debugger (gdb) to get a stack
trace. Also, recompile Mesa in debug mode to get more detailed information.
<li>Describe in detail how to reproduce the bug, especially with games
and applications that the Mesa developers might not be familiar with.
<li>Provide a simple GLUT-based test program if possible
</ul>

<p>
Bug reports will automatically be forwarded by bugzilla to the Mesa
developer's mailing list.
</p>

<p>
The easier a bug is to reproduce, the sooner it will be fixed.
Please do everything you can to facilitate quickly fixing bugs.
If your bug report is vague or your test program doesn't compile
easily, the problem may not be fixed very quickly.
