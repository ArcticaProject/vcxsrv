                              October 2, 2004

                              PLEASE READ!!!!



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 6.1) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 6.2) designate stable releases.


This release primarily just fixes bugs found in the Mesa 6.1 release.
See the VERSIONS file for details.


ToDo: PBO for polygon stipple, convolution filter, etc.



Known Issues
------------

The GL_EXT_pixel_buffer_object extension isn't fully implemented for
functions like glPolygonStipple, glConvolutionFilter, glColorTable,
etc.  The important functions like glRead/DrawPixels, glTex[Sub]Image,
and glBitmap work with PBOs.
