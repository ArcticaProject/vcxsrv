<H1>Help Wanted / To-Do List</H1>

<p>
We can always use more help with the Mesa project.
Here are some specific ideas and areas where help would be appreciated:
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<b>Driver patching and testing.</b>
Patches are often posted to the mesa3d-dev mailing list, but aren't
immediately checked into git because not enough people are testing them.
Just applying patches, testing and reporting back is helpful.
<li>
<b>Driver debugging.</b>
There are plenty of open bugs in the bug database.
<li>
<b>Remove aliasing warnings.</b>
Enable gcc -Wstrict-aliasing=2 -fstrict-aliasing and track down aliasing
issues in the code.
<li>
<b>Windows driver building, testing and maintenance.</b>
The Visual Studio project files aren't always updated in a timely manner
when new source files are added or old ones are removed.
Fixing these tends to delay new Mesa releases.
<li>
<b>Maintenance and testing of lesser-used drivers.</b>
Drivers such as DOS/DJGPP, GGI, etc that aren't being maintained are being
deprecated starting in Mesa 7.3.
<li>
<b>Contribute more tests to
<a href="http://glean.sourceforge.net/" target="_parent">glean</a>.</b>
<li>
<b>Automatic testing.
</b>
It would be great if someone would set up an automated system for grabbing
the latest Mesa code and run tests (such as glean) then report issues to
the mailing list.
</ol>


<p>
If you want to do something new in Mesa, first join the Mesa developer's
mailing list.
Then post a message to propose what you want to do, just to make sure
there's no issues.
</p>

</p>
Anyone is welcome to contribute code to the Mesa project.
By doing so, it's assumed that you agree to the code's licensing terms.
</p>

<p>
Finally:
<p>

<ol>
<li>Try to write high-quality code that follows the existing style.
<li>Use uniform indentation, write comments, use meaningful identifiers, etc.
<li>Test your code thoroughly.  Include test programs if appropriate.
</ol>
