<h1>Acknowledgements</h1>


The following individuals and groups are to be acknowledged for their
contributions to Mesa over the years.
This list is far from complete and somewhat dated, unfortunately.


<ul>
<li>Early Mesa development was done while Brian was part of the
<a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/~billh/vis.html">
SSEC Visualization Project</a> at the University of
Wisconsin. He'd like to thank Bill Hibbard for letting him work on
Mesa as part of that project.
<br>
<br>
<li>John Carmack of id Software, Inc. funded Keith Whitwell in 1999 in
order to optimize Mesa's vertex transformation module. This is a very
substantial piece of work.
<br>
<br>
<li>Precision Insight, Inc., VA Linux Systems, Inc., and most recently,
Tungsten Graphics, Inc. have supported the ongoing development of Mesa.
<br>
<br>
<li>The
<a href="http://www.mesa3d.org">Mesa</a>
website is hosted by
<a href="http://sourceforge.net">
