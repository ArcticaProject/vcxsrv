<H1>Mesa 7.7 Release Notes / date TBD</H1>

<p>
Mesa 7.7 is a new development release.
People who are concerned with stability and reliability should stick
with a previous release or wait for Mesa 7.7.1.
</p>
<p>
Mesa 7.7 implements the OpenGL 2.1 API, but the version reported by
glGetString(GL_VERSION) depends on the particular driver being used.
Some drivers don't support all the features required in OpenGL 2.1.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="install.html">Compiling/Installing page</a> for prerequisites
for DRI hardware acceleration.

<h2>New features</h2>
<ul>
<li>VMware "SVGA" Gallium driver.  This is a Gallium3D driver which targets the
    VMware virtual graphics device.  It allows Linux OpenGL guest applications
    to utilize the 3D graphics hardware of the host operating system.
<li>GL_ARB_draw_elements_base_vertex (supported in Intel i965 and software drivers)</li>
<li>GL_ARB_depth_clamp (supported in Intel i965 DRI and software drivers)</li>
<li>GL_NV_depth_clamp (supported in Intel i965 DRI and software drivers)</li>
<li>GL_ARB_provoking_vertex (same as GL_EXT_provoking_vertex)</li>
<li>Wavefront .obj file loader/viewer demo (progs/demos/objviewer)
</ul>


<h2>Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many assorted i965 driver fixes.
<li>Many r300-gallium driver fixes; this driver is now considered unstable-quality instead of experimental-quality.
</ul>


<h2>Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>New Mesa texture/surface format infrastructure
<li>Removed some unused Mesa device driver hooks
</ul>
