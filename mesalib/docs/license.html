<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

<p>
Mesa is a 3-D graphics library with an API which is very similar to
that of <a href="http://www.opengl.org/" target="_parent">OpenGL</a>.*
To the extent that Mesa utilizes the OpenGL command syntax or state
machine, it is being used with authorization from <a
href="http://www.sgi.com/" target="_parent">Silicon Graphics,
Inc.</a>(SGI). However, the author does not possess an OpenGL license
from SGI, and makes no claim that Mesa is in any way a compatible
replacement for OpenGL or associated with SGI. Those who want a
licensed implementation of OpenGL should contact a licensed
vendor.
</p>

<p>
Please do not refer to the library as <em>MesaGL</em> (for legal
reasons). It's just <em>Mesa</em> or <em>The Mesa 3-D graphics
library</em>. <br>
