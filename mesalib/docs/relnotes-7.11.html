<H1>Mesa 7.11 Release Notes / (release date TBD)</H1>

<p>
Mesa 7.11 is a new development release.
People who are concerned with stability and reliability should stick
with a previous release or wait for Mesa 7.11.1.
</p>
<p>
Mesa 7.11 implements the OpenGL 2.1 API, but the version reported by
glGetString(GL_VERSION) depends on the particular driver being used.
Some drivers don't support all the features required in OpenGL 2.1.
</p>
<p>
See the <a href="install.html">Compiling/Installing page</a> for prerequisites
for DRI hardware acceleration.
