		        Mesa 6.4 Release Notes

			   October 24, 2005



Introduction
------------

Mesa uses an even/odd version number scheme like the Linux kernel.
Odd numbered versions (such as 6.3) designate new developmental releases.
Even numbered versions (such as 6.4) designate stable releases.


6.4 is a bug-fix release.  See the VERSIONS file for details.



GLUT tarball
------------

Starting with 6.4, the GLUT library sources are distributed in a separate
tarball.  This was done at the request of Linux distro vendors who prefer
to use freeglut.




Driver			Status
----------------------	----------------------
DRI drivers		varies with the driver
XMesa (Xlib)		implements OpenGL 1.5
OSMesa (off-screen)	implements OpenGL 1.5
Windows/Win32		implements OpenGL 1.5
Glide (3dfx Voodoo1/2)  requires updates	
SVGA			requires updates
DJGPP			requires updates
GGI			requires updates
BeOS			requires updates
Allegro			requires updates
D3D			requires updates

The drivers which require updates mostly need to be updated to work
with the new gl_renderbuffer / gl_framebuffer infrastructure introduced
in Mesa 6.3.
