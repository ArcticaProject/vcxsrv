<H1>Introduction</H1>

<p>
Mesa is an open-source implementation of the
<a href="http://www.opengl.org/" target="_parent">OpenGL</a> specification -
a system for rendering interactive 3D graphics.
</p>

<p>
A variety of device drivers allows Mesa to be used in many different
environments ranging from software emulation to complete hardware acceleration
for modern GPUs.
</p>

<p>
Mesa ties into several other open-source projects: the 
<a href="http://dri.freedesktop.org/" target="_parent">Direct Rendering 
Infrastructure</a> and <a href="http://x.org" target="_parent">X.org</a> to 
provide OpenGL support to users of X on Linux, FreeBSD and other operating 
systems.
</p>



<H1>Project History</H1>

<p>
The Mesa project was originally started by Brian Paul.
Here's a short history of the project.
</p>

<p>
August, 1993: I begin working on Mesa in my spare time.  The project
has no name at that point.  I was simply interested in writing a simple
3D graphics library that used the then-new OpenGL API.  I was partially
inspired by the <em>VOGL</em> library which emulated a subset of IRIS GL.
I had been programming with IRIS GL since 1991.
</p>

<p>
November 1994: I contact SGI to ask permission to distribute my OpenGL-like
graphics library on the internet.  SGI was generally receptive to the
idea and after negotiations with SGI's legal department, I get permission
to release it.
</p>

<p>
February 1995: Mesa 1.0 is released on the internet.  I expected that
a few people would be interested in it, but not thousands.
I was soon receiving patches, new features and thank-you notes on a
daily basis.  That encouraged me to continue working on Mesa.  The
name Mesa just popped into my head one day.  SGI had asked me not to use
the terms <em>"Open"</em> or <em>"GL"</em> in the project name and I didn't
want to make up a new acronym.  Later, I heard of the Mesa programming
language and the Mesa spreadsheet for NeXTStep.
</p>

<p>
In the early days, OpenGL wasn't available on too many systems.
It even took a while for SGI to support it across their product line.
Mesa filled a big hole during that time.
For a lot of people, Mesa was their first introduction to OpenGL.
I think SGI recognized that Mesa actually helped to promote
the OpenGL API, so they didn't feel threatened by the project.
</p>


<p>
1995-1996: I continue working on Mesa both during my spare time and during
my work hours at the Space Science and Engineering Center at the University
of Wisconsin in Madison.  My supervisor, Bill Hibbard, lets me do this because
Mesa is now being using for the <a href="http://www.ssec.wisc.edu/%7Ebillh/vis.html" target="_parent">Vis5D</a> project.
</p><p>
October 1996: Mesa 2.0 is released.  It implements the OpenGL 1.1 specification.
</p>

<p>
March 1997: Mesa 2.2 is released.  It supports the new 3dfx Voodoo graphics
card via the Glide library.  It's the first really popular hardware OpenGL
implementation for Linux.
</p>

<p>
September 1998: Mesa 3.0 is released.  It's the first publicly-available
implementation of the OpenGL 1.2 API.
</p>

<p>
March 1999: I attend my first OpenGL ARB meeting.  I contribute to the
development of several official OpenGL extensions over the years.
</p>

<p>
September 1999: I'm hired by Precision Insight, Inc.  Mesa is a key
component of 3D hardware acceleration in the new DRI project for XFree86.
Drivers for 3dfx, 3dLabs, Intel, Matrox and ATI hardware soon follow.
</p>

<p>
October 2001: Mesa 4.0 is released.
It implements the OpenGL 1.3 specification.
</p>


<p>
November 2001: I cofound <a href="http://www.tungstengraphics.com" target="_parent">
Tungsten Graphics, Inc.</a> with Keith Whitwell, Jens Owen, David Dawes and
Frank LaMonica.
I continue to develop Mesa as part of my resposibilities with Tungsten
Graphics and as a spare-time project.
</p>

<p>
November 2002: Mesa 5.0 is released.
It implements the OpenGL 1.4 specification.
</p>

<p>
January 2003: Mesa 6.0 is released.  It implements the OpenGL 1.5
specification as well as the GL_ARB_vertex_program and
GL_ARB_fragment_program extensions.
</p>

<p>
June 2007: Mesa 7.0 is released, implementing the OpenGL 2.1 specification
and OpenGL Shading Language.
</p>


<p>
Ongoing: Mesa is used as the core of many hardware OpenGL drivers for
the XFree86 and X.org X servers within the
<A href="http://dri.freedesktop.org/" target="_parent">DRI project</A>.
I continue to enhance Mesa with new extensions and features.
</p>



<H1>Major Versions</H1>

<p>
This is a summary of the major versions of Mesa.
Mesa's major version number has been incremented whenever a new version
of the OpenGL specification is implemented.
</p>


<H2>Version 7.x features</H2>
<p>
Version 7.x of Mesa implements the OpenGL 2.1 API.  The main feature
of OpenGL 2.x is the OpenGL Shading Language.
