The design of the X11 Intrinsics was done primarily by Joel McCormack
of Digital WSL. Major contributions to the design and implementation
also were done by Charles Haynes, Mike Chow, and Paul Asente of Digital
WSL. Additional contributors to the design and/or implementation were:

The contributors to the X10 toolkit also deserve mention. Although the X11 Intrinsics present an
entirely different programming style, they borrow heavily from the implicit and
explicit concepts in the X10 toolkit.

Thanks go to Al Mento of Digital’s UEG Documentation Group for formatting and generally
improving this document and to John Ousterhout of Berkeley for extensively reviewing early
drafts of it.

Finally, a special thanks to Mike Chow, whose extensive performance analysis of the X10 toolkit
provided the justification to redesign it entirely for X11.

The current design of the Intrinsics has benefited greatly from the
input of several dedicated reviewers in the membership of the X
Consortium. In addition to those already mentioned, the following
individuals have dedicated significant time to suggesting improvements
to the Intrinsics:

From Release 3 to Release 4, several new members joined the design team. We greatly appreciate
the thoughtful comments, suggestions, lengthy discussions, and in some cases implementation
code contributed by each of the following:

In Release 5, the effort to define the internationalization additions was headed by Bill McMahon
of Hewlett Packard and Frank Rojas of IBM. This has been an educational process for many of
us, and Bill and Frank’s tutelage has carried us through. Vania Joloboff of the OSF also contributed
to the internationalization additions. The implementation efforts of Bill, Gabe Beged-Dov,
and especially Donna Converse for this release are also gratefully acknowledged.

The Release 6 Intrinsics is a result of the collaborative efforts of participants in the X Consortium’s
intrinsics working group. A few individuals contributed substantial design proposals, participated
in lengthy discussions, reviewed final specifications, and in most cases, were also
responsible for sections of the implementation. They deserve recognition and thanks for their
major contributions:

Many others analyzed designs, offered useful comments and suggestions, and participated in a
significant subset of the process. The following people deserve thanks for their contributions:
Andy Bovingdon, Sam Chang, Chris Craig, George Erwin-Grotsky, Keith Edwards, Clive
Feather, Stephen Gildea, Dan Heller, Steve Humphrey, David Kaelbling, Jaime Lau, Rob Lembree,
Stuart Marks, Beth Mynatt, Tom Paquin, Chris Peterson, Kamesh Ramakrishna, Tom
Rodriguez, Jim VanGilder, Will Walker, and Mike Wexler.

<para>
I am especially grateful to two of my colleagues: Ralph Swick for expert editorial guidance, and
Kaleb Keithley for leadership in the implementation and the specification work.
