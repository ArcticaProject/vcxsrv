<para>
Elements separated by vertical bar (|) are alternatives.
Curly braces ({...}) indicate zero or more repetitions
of the enclosed elements.
Square brackets ([...]) indicate that the enclosed element is optional.
Quotes ("...") are used around literal characters.
</para>

<para>
If the last character on a line is a backslash (\),
that line is assumed to continue on the next line.
</para>

<para>
To allow a Value to begin with whitespace,
the two-character sequence "\<emphasis remap='I'>space</emphasis>" (backslash followed by space)
is recognized and replaced by a space character,
and the two-character sequence "\<emphasis remap='I'>tab</emphasis>"
(backslash followed by horizontal tab)
is recognized and replaced by a horizontal tab character.
</para>
<para>
To allow a Value to contain embedded newline characters,
the two-character sequence "\n" is recognized and replaced by a
newline character.
To allow a Value to be broken across multiple lines in a text file,
the two-character sequence "\<emphasis remap='I'>newline</emphasis>"
(backslash followed by newline) is
recognized and removed from the value.
</para>
<para>
To allow a Value to contain arbitrary character codes,
the four-character sequence "\<emphasis remap='I'>nnn</emphasis>",
where each <emphasis remap='I'>n</emphasis> is a digit character in the range of "0"-"7",
is recognized and replaced with a single byte that contains
the octal value specified by the sequence.
Finally, the two-character sequence "\\" is recognized
and replaced with a single backslash.
