<title>Athena Widgets and The Intrinsics</title>
<para>
The X Toolkit is made up of two distinct pieces, the Xt Intrinsics and a
widget set.  The Athena widget set is a sample implementation of a
widget set built upon the Intrinsics.  In the X Toolkit, a widget is the
combination of an X window or subwindow and its associated input and
output semantics.
</para>
<para>
Because the Intrinsics provide the same basic functionality to all widget
sets it may be possible to use widgets from the Athena widget set with
other widget sets based upon the Intrinsics.  Since widget sets may also
implement private protocols, all functionality may not be available when
mixing and matching widget sets.  For information about the Intrinsics, see
the <emphasis remap='I'>X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface</emphasis>.
</para>
<para>
The Athena widget set is a library package layered on top of the Intrinsics
and Xlib that provides a set of user interface tools sufficient to build
a wide variety of applications.  This layer extends the basic
abstractions provided by X and provides the next layer of functionality
primarily by supplying a cohesive set of sample widgets.  Although the
Intrinsics are a Consortium standard, there is no standard widget set.
</para>

<para>
To the extent possible, the Intrinsics are "policy-free".  The application
environment and widget set, not the Intrinsics, define, implement, and
enforce:

<para>
Each individual widget implementation defines its own policy.  The X Toolkit
design allows for, but does not necessarily encourage, the free mixing
of radically differing widget implementations.

The X Toolkit provides tools that simplify the design of
application user interfaces in the X Window System programming environment.
It assists application programmers by providing a set of common
underlying user-interface functions.  It also lets widget programmers
modify existing widgets, by subclassing, or add new widgets.  By using
the X Toolkit in their applications, programmers can present a similar
user interface across applications to all workstation users.

The X Toolkit consists of:

While the majority of the Intrinsics functions are intended
for the widget programmer,
a subset of the Intrinsics functions are to be used by application programmers
(see  <emphasis remap='I'>X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface</emphasis>).
The architectural model lets the widget programmer design new widgets
by using the Intrinsics and by combining other widgets.
The application interface layers built on top of the X Toolkit include a
coordinated set of widgets and composition policies.
Some of these widgets and policies are specific to a single
application domain, and others are common to a variety of
applications.

A data abstraction consisting of private data and private and public
functions that operate on the private data.
Users of the abstraction can interact with the object only through calls
to the object's public functions.
In the X Toolkit,
some of the object's public functions are called directly by the application,
while others are called indirectly when the application calls the common
Intrinsics functions.
In general, if a function is common to all widgets,
an application uses a single Intrinsics function to invoke the function for all
types of widgets.
If a function is unique to a single widget type,
the widget exports the function.

Widget semantics are clearly separated from widget layout geometry.
Widgets are concerned with implementing specific user-interface
semantics.  They have little control over issues such as their size or
placement relative to other widget peers.  Mechanisms are provided for
associating geometric managers with widgets and for widgets to make
suggestions about their own geometry.

The Intrinsics define a resource on all Shell widgets that interact with
the window manager called <function>input</function>.  This resource requests the
assistance of window manager in acquiring the input focus.  The
resource defaults to <function>False</function> in the Intrinsics, but is redefined to
default to <function>True</function> when an application is using the Athena widget
set.  An application programmer may override this default and set the
resource back to <function>False</function> if the application does not need the window
manager to give it the input focus.  See the
<emphasis remap='I'>X Toolkit Intrinsics - C Language Interface</emphasis> for details
on the <emphasis remap='I'>input</emphasis> resource.
