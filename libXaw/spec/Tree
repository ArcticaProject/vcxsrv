.LP
The Tree widget provides geometry management of arbitrary widgets arranged
in a directed, acyclic graph (i.e., a tree).  The hierarchy is constructed
by attaching a constraint resource called \fBtreeParent\fP to each widget
indicating which other node in the tree should be treated as the widget's
superior.  The structure of the tree is shown by laying out the nodes
in the standard format for tree diagrams with lines drawn connecting each
node with its children.
.LP
The Tree sizes itself according to the needs of its children and is not
intended to be resized by its parent.  Instead, it should be placed inside
another composite widget (such as the \fBPorthole\fP or \fBViewport\fP)
that can be used to scroll around in the tree.

Resources

When creating a Tree widget instance, the following resources are
retrieved from the argument list or from the resource database:

\fBSouthGravity\fP.

children and the edge of the box.

Constraint Resources
.LP
.IN "Tree widget" "constraint resources"
Each child of the Tree widget must specify its superior node in the tree.  In
addition, it may specify a GC to use when drawing a line between it and its
inferior nodes.

lw(1i) lw(1i) lw(1i) lw(.5i) lw(2i).

.IP \fBtreeGC\fP 1.5i
This specifies the GC to use when drawing lines between this widget and its
inferiors in the tree.  If this resource is not specified, the Tree's
\fBforeground\fP and \fBlineWidth\fP will be used.
.IP \fBtreeParent\fP 1.5i
This specifies the superior node in the tree for this widget.  The default is
for the node to have no superior (and to therefore be at the top of the tree).
.NH 3
Layout Semantics
.IN "Tree widget" "layout semantics"
.LP
Each time a child is managed or unmanaged, the Tree widget will attempt
to reposition the remaining children to fix the shape of the tree if the
.B autoReconfigure
resource is set.  Children at the top (most superior) of the tree are
drawn at
the side specified by the
.B gravity
resource.
.LP
After positioning all children, the Tree widget attempts to shrink its
own size to the minimum dimensions required for the layout.
.NH 3
Convenience Routines
.LP
.IN "Tree widget" "convenience routines"
The most efficient way to layout a tree is to set
.B autoReconfigure
to False and then use the
.B XawTreeForceLayout
routine to arrange the children.
