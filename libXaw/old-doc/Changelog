Patch 1 (#1655) 15 April 1998

  Description of the actions system:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
  All the actions have the syntax:

action-name(boolean-expression, args)

  Where:
action-name:
	Any string with a translation binding in the binary for the widget.

boolean-expression:
	[{~}]variable-name|resource-name|constant-name[{&|^}[[{~}]variable-name|resource-name|constant-name]]...

variable-name:
	Any string starting with a '$' character (actually it's not possible
	to mask this character; I'll fix it). Variables are actually created
	with the translations 'declare' and 'get-values'. Example:
	get-values(1, $x, x)
	declare(1, $armed, true)

resource-name:
	Any resource name of the widget. Note that it requires a <TYPE> to
	string converter in the code (I added some on the patches), since
	all variables values are stored in a 'String' format. Example:
	borderWidth
	height
	font
	background

constant-name:
	Especial values. They aren't normally contants, but a special state
	not triggered with resources or variables (They have the highest
	precedence, so, to allow these strings as resource names I'll need
	to allow some sort of escape sequences). Examples:
	mine	# event->xany.window == XtWindow(widget)
	faked	# event->xany.send_event != 0
	true	# you know
	false	# "   "

args:
	Special strings values interpreted by the translation binding.

The operators (currently) understood are:
	~ - NOT
	& - AND
	| - OR
	^ - XOR
	( - RP
	) - LP
	The final result value is and'ed with 1.

Sample translation to make a label widget behave like a button:
<Map>:\
	get-values(1, $fg, foreground, $bg, background)\n\
<Btn1Down>:\
	set-values(1, foreground, yellow, background, gray30)\n\
<Btn1Up>:\
	set-values(1, foreground, $fg, background, $bg)\n


  Description of the displayList system:
--------------------------------------------------------------------
  The display list has the syntax:

[class-name:]function-name	args[{;|\n}]...

  Where:
class-name:
	Any registered set of functions. The code registers the class 'xlib',
	and if the class name is not specified, this class is assumed.

function-name:
	A string binding to the correct function to be called.

args:
	A set of converted and shareable arguments, to the function. The
	positioning/sizing arguments currently implemented have the syntax:
{+-}<integer> or <integer>/<integer>. Examples:
	+0,+0  top, left
	-0,-0  bottom, right
	-+10,-+10  bottom+10, right+10
	+0,1/2    left, vcenter

  All displayLists are shared by:
	widget->core.screen
	widget->core.colormap
	widget->core.depth
  I have added only partial code for handling non-windowed widgets (gadgets).
I'll fix it.

  Example for drawing two lines crossing the widget:
foreground	black;\
line		+0,+0,-0,-0;\
line		+0,-0,-0,+0



Patch 2 (#1660) 19 April 1998

  + More functions for displayList's
  + Fixes for simpleMenuWidget, xfontsel should work very better now. Try
    this with the newer patches to verify the changes:
    xfontsel -xrm '*XFontSel*SimpleMenu*font:
-*-helvetica-medium-r-*-*-16-*-*-*-*-*-*-1'
  + Small bug fix to boxWidget, viewres should work better now. Try this
    to verify the changes:
    viewres -xrm '*Viewres*Box.borderWidth: 1'
  + Small bug fix to panedWidget, when pressing in a gripWidget but not
    moving the pointer, or releasing at the same coordinates.

Patch 3 (#1673) 25 April 1998

 + Changes in layout code for the Form widget. To see the changes, run xcalc
   and resize it several times (try giving it a very small size and the
   restore the size). The new code uses a 'known' reference size/position
   to avoid integer rounding problems.
 + A optimization for the Form widget. Now it unmaps itself before resizing
   the child widgets. This way the layout process is very faster.
 + The List widget will try to fit in a 32767x32767 window size. It checks
   if the width or height will become bigger than 32767 and if will, changes
   the number of columns. This fixes xman (at least for me, that have several
   entries in the section 3 of the manpages).
 + New functions to displayList's and fixes to some bad bugs (I'm yet working
   on that file).
 + Change in the Scrollbar functionality. It was redrawing the thumb when
   triggering the MoveThumb action. This is bad because several programs
   choose to recalculate the thumb position with XawScrollbarSetThumb, causing
   screen flickering. Now it redraws the thumb when triggering the NotifyThumb
   action. To verify the changes, run xfm or xman and try to scroll past the
   end of a window; it will keep erasing and redrawing the thumb.
 + Other change in the Scrollbar is that it will only draw in the rectangle:
   1, 1, core.width - 1, core.height - 1. It is better when creatting a 3d
   effect with displayList's.


Patch 4 (#1678) 3 May 1998

Included the patches for the recent problems with libXaw.
Several 'gratuitous' small changes, to compile cleanly with gcc -Wall.
Some bug fixes for DisplayList.c.
Colored pixmaps support. I'm building a abstraction layer for the colored
  pixmaps, so that it should be easy to support more pixmap formats
  (actually, only X bitmaps).


Patch 5 (#1686) 11 May 1998

 + Patch to libXmu, so that the StringToCursor converter will understand the
   string 'None', that means not to use a cursor. This is useful when
   overriding resource settings, and the user wants to use the parent window
   cursor, or the root window cursor. Any unrecognized name will generate
   a 'None' cursor, but then with a warning message.
 + SimpleWidget was modified to allow setting the cursor to none, when it
   was a valid cursor.
 + Modification in the Actions.c,
   from:
	typedef struct _XawActionVar {
	  XrmQuark qname;
	  String value;
	} XawActionVar;
   to:
	typedef struct _XawActionVar {
	  XrmQuark qname;
	  XrmQuark qvalue;
	} XawActionVar;
   This does not cause any problems, since the exported interface remains
   the same. This is required to avoid to much copies of the same string.
 + Values of action variables can start with '$'.
 + If a resource name clashes with a special constant name when evaluating
   a boolean expression (in the translations code), it's enough
   start the resource name with '\\' (it can always be used, but is
   only useful if there is a name clash :).
 + The only code that loads data files actually is the pixmap code. To avoid
   security problems, the code only loads files that are group readable,
   regular file, non suid and non sgid.
 + If the code to load a pixmap does not find a match, and the pixmap name
   has a extension, try without the extension.
 + Function 'line-with' added to displayList code.
 + Added DisplayListToString and PixmapToString converters.
 + Bug fixes in the pixmap name interpretation.


Patch 6 (#1701) 24 May 1998

  Xaw
 ------
 + Allows setting the resources label_x and label_y inherited from labelWidget.
   This is useful for moving the contents of a button when it is pressed
   ( I included a simple test for it )
 + Added OS/2 patchs
 + The buffer overflow problems were resolved in a different way. I added
   a function XmuSnprintf, that is used by Xaw and Xmu.
 + Correction of a problem in SimpleMenu, when it tries to optimize the
   space used by the menu.

  Xmu
 -----
 + Function XmuNCopyISOLatin1Lowered, defined in <X11/Xmu/CharSet.h>
 + Function XmuSnprintf, defined in <X11/Xmu/SysUtil.h>
 + All ocurrences of sprintf were replaced by XmuSnprintf and all ocurrences
   of XmuCopyISOLatin1Lowered were replaced by XmuNCopyISOLation1Lowered.


Patch 7 (#1738) 21 June 1998

  + Corrected problem with the Command widget, when it was made insensitive
    without calling the 'reset' action.
  + Rework of the SimpleMenu code for optimizing the space used. Now it
    really works as intended.
  + Fixed portability problems with my previous patches.
  + Corrected problem pointed by 'grano@cs.Helsinki.FI'. He have followed up
    a bug report to the devel mailing list. While the problem exist, his
    patch was not complete, so I did a rework of the AsciiSrc.c:Scan() and
    MultiSrc.c:Scan() functions.
  + I added clipping code to the {Ascii,Multi}Sink widgets, to allow use of
    displayList's as decoration. The best solution I found to avoid too much
    server requests, and keep full binary compatability was to use the resize
    method of these widgets, to tell them to the parent widget have changed
    it's size.
  + Now the TextWidget has a xterm/emacs like cursor. And it is possible to
    especify a cursor color.
  + Fixed several problems caused by code assuming a line of text will be
    shown as one line in the TextWidget. This is not always true when
    it uses XawtextWrapLine or XawTextWrapWord, the most common problem was
    the cursor becomming invisible, after calling the function
    Text.c:_XawTextShowPosition() that is called to make sure it is visible ;)
  + Added code that it will not forget the cursor distance from the left of
    the window while moving the cursor one line up or down.
  + Ansification of the text code (not yet complete). Private routines now
    uses prototypes and wide parameters. External routines were kept
    as before (but with prototypes not masked by NeedFunctionPrototypes),
    to avoid binary compatability problems. The bigger problem I found in the
    ansification was a function with 6 parameters being called with only 5.
  + Several routines were rewritten, sometimes from scratch.
  + The cursor navigation of the TextWidget was completely reviewed. It
    should be very familiar to Emacs users. The most Emacs like behaviour is
    when the cursor in move one line up or down and becomes invisible; the
    text will be scrolled so that the line with the cursor will be centered
    in the screen. Also, when doing page up, the cursor will be positioned
    in the bottom-left, instead of allways in the top-left.

Patch 8 (#1752) 27 June 1998

  + There was a problem with the previous patch regarding to portability.
    The problem was strcasecmp. I was planning to provide the funcionality
    in libXmu, and forgot when creating the previous patch :(. There is
    already a strcasecmp equivalent in libXmu, that is
    Lower.c:XmuCompareISOLatin1(), so I used that function.
  + The previous patch was working correctly for viewing text, but there were
    some cases the text window could end not displaying correctly the text.
    This problem was fixed.
  + Now, the only real need of scrollbars is when doing long jumps on the
    text, because the cursor will be always visible since this new patch
    does horizontal scrolling automatically.


Patch 9 (#1755) 28 June 1998

  + Removed all my RCS idents in the files.
  + Declared functions as static in the prototype and in the definition
    (this basically reverts a previous patch, but should help when applying
     the patches sequentially).
  + Changed the code in Pixmap.c to use strtok instead of strsep, that is
    not portable.
  + Corrected problem with previous patch that would cause trouble when
    a text widget had more than 32K bytes, and would also cause offset
    mismatches if a program access private structures (AsciiSinkP.h).


#1776 6 July 1998

Corrected problem when moving the cursor over a non-printing character,
  i.e. ^Q ^X
Does not allow anymore scrolling of the text width Ctrl+Z if the text has
  only one line, or only one line of text.
Several changes in the TextWidget. I did not gratuitously break binary
  compatability. Source compatability is only granted to programs that
  do not access private structures. This is required because there are
  several changes in the behaviour of the TextWidget, and if a program
  becomes non compilable, it is because it will not work properly with
  the changes in the text widget (please read bellow for a explanation)
Better cursor navigation when moving line-up or line-down over a tab:
                cursor
                |
                v
    spaces   | |#| | | |text
    tab      |         |text
   Move one line down:
        before:
    tab      |#        |text
        now:
    tab      |         |#ext
There were several problems in the Text.c:_XawTextReplace(), when deleting
  a character and the cursor (shoud be) moved to the previous line. This
  problem was corrected.
The text code was doing too much redrawing! When typping text, it would
  redraw all the current line at each character typped, and also redraw the
  entire window till the bottom. Now it only redraws the minimum necessary
  (and makes a minimum of requests for the Xserver, when clearing areas),
  most of these problems were related to Text.c:_XawTextReplace() (rewritten
  from scratch), Text.c:_BuildLineTable() (mostly rewritten) and
  Text.c:DisplayText() (mostly rewritten).
Now, when selecting text, with: button1-down, button1-move, the window will
  be scrolled automatically, if the mouse is moved to the top or bottom of
  the text window, making it easier to extend selections.
Added a set-keyboard-focus translation to the text code, and in the
  default translation, it is called when pressing the left mouse button over
  a text widget (so that the mouse does not need to be over the text window
  when typping)

These are the changes to Xaw that made it not fully source compatable (I'm
open to comments, to make it source compatable, but as I said above, if
a program does not compile anymore, it is because it is not granted it will
work properly):
scrollMode set to WhenNeeded is not supported anymore. I spent several
  hours fighting side-effects caused when a scrollbar is created or destroyed
  'on demand', and have (after tired of long debug sessions) choosed that
  it is not required (it saves a lot of potencial unespected conditions
  being found by a user). I changed the 'type' of the scroll mode to Boolean,
  so, to have a scrollbar, is enough to say: *Text.scrollVertical: True.
  Since the type now is Boolean, Xt will print warning messages when the
  scroll is set to 'Always', 'Never' or 'WhenNeeded'
automatic resize is nonsense since the text does automatic horizontal
  scrolling. IMHO, to be useful, automatic resize should also shrink the
  text window when needed, anyway, it's not required anymore

Comments:
auto-fill mode does not work properly (never did)
wrap-mode set to line may not work properly
wrap-mode set to word does not work properly always (never did)
the multiply should be setable to a variable value; the default value
  is 4, i.e. Ctrl+U <text+action>
I will work on the itens listed above, and I'm also planning:
one level undo, for text actions
C style indentation and 'jumping' the cursor to show matching '(', '['
  and '{'
other things that I don't remember now :)


-- XMU --
Moved the code clipping code I have put in Text.c in my previous patch to
  Xmu/Clip.c. There was a bug in the code I have put in Text.c (this is what
  I get by cutting and pasting code under a #if 0 :(), but it was corrected.
  The code in the new file 'Clip.c' is very useful for creating clipiing lists
  and thus, avoiding too much server requests, or code for the same
  functionality (poorly) repeteated in several places around the libary. This
  code is now heavily used by the TextWidget.


-- XEDIT -- 
Removed a XDefineCursor in xedit.c:main(). There are several ways to specify
  a cursor for a program (most times inherited from the wm decoration window),
  so, it is better to let the user choose one.
Before starting the main loop, now xedit sets the keyboard focus to the
  text window if a file was loaded, or to the prompt for a file name if
  none was especified in the command line (do not use the new xedit without
  the new Xaw library, or you will not be able to change the keyboard focus).
Updated the Scrollbar configurations in Xedit.ad
  

#1788 12 July 1998

-- TextWidget --
 + Corrected problem whem moving the cursor over a non-printing character
 + Now, does not allow scroll with ^Z when there is only one line of text
 + Automatic resize was removed, it is not required with automatic horizontal
   scroll, but I will look for programs that rely on it; the only program
   affected (that I know) is xmh, because it popups dialogs of a small size,
   and expects that the text widget (with a warning message) do a geometry  
   request.
 + Scroll mode set to "WhenNeeded" was removed. It generates several unespected
   conditions when editing text, and the new feature of automatic scrolling
   the text widget while typping is more useful.
 + Removed a leak in TextAction.c:AutoFill(), generated by the code
        text.ptr =  (char *)XtMalloc(sizeof(wchar_t) * 2);
   that memory was never released, but the fix was simple, since the amount
   of memory requested is fixed.
 + Several optimizations in the redisplay of the text.
 + Now, wrap mode set to word or line is expected to work, while typping text.
 + AutoFill will only break lines in word boundaries now.
 + Added a set-keyboard-focus action to TextAction.c, so that when pressing
   the left button over a text widget, it will receive the keyboard focus.
   This behaviour is the default, but can be disabled, with something like:
        *Text.translations: #override\n<Btn1Down>: select-start()\n
   in your .Xdefaults.
 + Corrected several cases that would left the text widget showing incorrect
   data. All the problems should have been fixed, but in case you find one,
   a quick fix is:
        *Text.backgroundPixmap: black?foreground=<some-color>
   because it does not try to optimize the redrawing when using a background
   pixmap, and thus, avoid several possible problems.


-- XAW --
 + I had added a XawStackAlloc definition to "Private.h", to avoid a XtMalloc
   request for every character typped in TextAction.c:InsertChar(), but
   when syncing with 3.9Aj, saw that the file "XawAlloc.h" is no longer
   required. Please, remove XawAlloc.h from 3.9Aj.


-- XMU --
 + Added the file Clip.c, with clipping code, that, now is being used by
   the text widget, but can be used by other widgets.

-- xedit --
 + Removed a XDefineCursor from xedit.c:main()
 + I have added a XtSetKeyboardFocus in xedit.c:main(), but comented it
   because it would make xedit unusable with previous versions of Xaw,
   or with the Xaw replacements (Xaw3d, Xaw95 ...)

Comments:
  I wrote a lot of code to work properly with italic fonts in the text widget,
that code made the cursor do not erase portions of the text while moving the
it, but it was failing at some places that would need that the TextWidget,
and not only the {Ascii,Multi}SinkObject had access to the fonts, so I
choosed to left it to the future (and keep the sources simple, by now).
The text widget is useable with italic fonts, but fonts with:
        f->per_char[<char> - f->min_char_or_byte2].rbearing
          > f->per_char[<char> - f->min_char_or_byte2].width
or
        f->per_char[<char> - f->min_char_or_byte2].lbearing < 0
will not allways be displayed correctly.

  I haved also added a xedit configuration file to this mail.


#1842 27 July 1998

Fixed problem with the default macro for type conversion, where it was
  possible to the code tell the wrong size of a string, since it was
  returning the string size with 'strlen' but making the copy with strcpy.
Complete ansification of Xaw (and Xmu).
Corrected some problems caused due to an alteration in the text code, to 
  make the cursor always visible when the wrap mode is 'line' or 'word'.
Text.c:VJump() was made a bit smarter and a problem that would cause it
  to jump incorrectly was also corrected so that now the jumping should be
  very smooth.
Corrected problem that would cause a coredump due to the
  Text.c:_XawTextReplace() deferencing a NULL pointer. Now ctx->text.lt.info
  is initialized when the text widget is created, solving this problem.
All the variables with name 'new' and 'class' where renamed to 'cnew' and
  'cclass'. This allows even building Xaw with 'gcc -x c++'.
Variables shadowing other variables or functions where also renamed.
Static functions were changed to use wide parameters, where applicable.
(Almost) every time a StringTo<Type> converter is installed in the class
  initialization of a widget, the code also installs a <Type>ToString converter
  since now editres seens to work better.
Complete reestilization of the indentation. See the files Template*.{c,h}.
Corrected problem with the 'virtual' function Layout of the Form widget. That
  function requires 4 parameters, but the Viewport widget (a Form subclass) was
  calling that function with only 3 parameters; the ansification flagred that
  error.
TextTr.c was modified to have only one string. I believe that that weird
  thing was due to the inheritance of compatability with some very old and
  probably buggy ld.
Xaw is expected to be binary compatable with R6.3; there are some
  preprocessor macros that keeps binary compatability, and unless the gains
  of breaking binary compatability show worth enough (and people think) it
  is good that code would be made default, otherwise it will be forgotten.
I have also added a XFree86 copyright notice to Text.c, since there is
  a very large amount of work in that file (and it is not yet ready).
---------------------

-------- Xmu --------
Complete ansification of Xmu.
Rework of EditresCom.c to allow editres working correctly. It was also
  added a new feature, that allows editres finding some extra child widgets,
  i.e. widgets that aren't a child of a subclass of composite and aren't in
  the popup list. This modification is not enough, since it does not find
  child widgets that don't a XtRWidget resource in the parent widget.
Rework of ShapeWidg.c, so that it will give the correct feeling to the
  ellipse shape, and inversion of the oval, if shape is oval and
  height > width. To see these changes, run a program with:
  <prog> -xrm '*shapeStyle: ellipse'
  and/or
  <prog> -xrm '*shapeStyle: oval'
Revision of DrRndRect.c to make the widget looks 'more correct' when using:
  <prog> -xrm '*shapeStyle: roundedRectangle'
---------------------

------ editres ------
Added small patch to bug in handler.c so that editres will correctly now.
---------------------

------- xedit -------
Changed the resources file, to avoid a problem when resizing xedit to a
  very small size and than restoring it's size. Probably the culprit is the
  Paned widget, but the new resource file is at least a good workaround for
  the problem.
The resource file was also modified so that the default xedit size will
  give a 80x25 rows/columns when using the default font.
---------------------

-------- xgc --------
Small patch to clear correctly the status text window, when pressing the
  'Clear window' button. Note that this patch showed a bug in
  Xaw/{Ascii,Multi}Src.c; only apply this patch with the latest Xaw, or
  be sure that Xaw/{Ascii,Multi}Src.c:*SetValues() has something like:
  if (old_src->ascii_src.ascii_length != src->ascii_src.ascii_length)
      src->ascii_src.piece_size = src->ascii_src.ascii_length + 1;
  instead of:
  if (old_src->ascii_src.ascii_length != src->ascii_src.ascii_length)
      src->ascii_src.piece_size = src->ascii_src.ascii_length;
  or it will enter a infinite XtMalloc(0) loop :(
also fixed a possible buffer overflow while searching the source of the
  bug described above.
---------------------

#1945, 31 Aug 1998

-- XAW -- 
 + Corrected bug in Viewport.c:ComputeLayout(), that would put the scrollbar
   in the incorrect position, if w->viewport.useright == True
 + Corrected bug in Converters.c:_XawCvtCARD32ToString(), so that now it
   will correctly format the converted value.
 + Corrected problem in {Ascii,Multi}Src.c:Search(), that would cause a
   incorrect offset to be returned, if the searched text (or a substring of
   it) were in a 'Piece' boundary.
 + Some small patches to other sections of the code, to reduce the number
   of warnings generated by gcc, when using more restrictive warning options.

-- XMU --
 + Corrected a problem in Atoms.c:GetAtomName(), to return a NULL pointer,
   instead of a const if the given atom is 0.
 + Corrected a typo in Xmu.h
 + Several 'ansification' patches, to get function definitions and avoid
   unecessary definitions.


#2028, 2033, 7 Oct 1998

-- Xaw -- 
Added a delete translation to the text widget, that deletes the current
  selection if any, else the backwards char.
Corrected bug that would not update correctly the screen if page-up or
  page-down was pressed while there was an selection.
Added a ^Q<any-char> translation to the text widget, to be able to insert
  any char in the text.
Changed TextAction.c:Move() to set ctx->text.showposition, so that even
  if the cursor did not change the position, it will become visible.
Corrected problem with the 'form-paragraph' translation, so that the
  text will be always correclty shown.
Modified the automatic scrolling of the text to one line at a time, to
  make it easier to see what is being selected.
Added a 'hack' to be able to type ^U<any-numeric-sequence> to be able
  set the multiply of the text widget. Since it is a hack (besides seens
  to work very well) it can be disabled with -DNO_NUMERIC_HACK
Corrected a nasty bug in Text.c:CvtStringToScrollMode(); XtConvertAndStore
  can't be called from a type converter!
added UNDO/REDO to the text widget. Please try it, I think it is very nice.
  Undo is enabled by the new resource 'enableUndo', and, by default is  
  triggered with 'Ctrl+_'.

-- editres --
Resubmitting a patch to editres/handler.c, to make editres work properly.

-- xedit -- 
NOTE that with this patch, xedit probably will not work with Xaw3d, neXtaw...
  this surelly can be fixed, or in the xedit side or the *Xaw* side, but
  the patch seens to be necessary.
Changed the defaults file to be more user friendly and previsible.
  Added some 'Emacs like' binding translations.
Added file completion in the filename prompt. This is a very nice
  feature, but I'm not sure if the code is portable to all the XFree86  
  supported platforms (surely it will not work 'as is' with OS/2).


#2083 18 Oct 1998

-- XAW --
Changed the functions {Ascii,Multi}Sink.c:CharWidth and PaintText, to
  improve speed, and avoid too much recalculations. On normal files, it
  becames about 5:1 faster, but can go up to 20:1 when editting files with
  very large lines. Besides this speed improvement, I believe it can
  surely be made faster (based on comparition with some popular X editors).
Changed the way the AsciiSink prints characters with value bigger than
  126 decimal. Now it prints DEL as ^?, and the other characters as \XXX
  where 'X' is an octal digit. The MultiSink widget was unchanged in this  
  respect, i.e. when calling xedit with something like:
  xedit -xrm '*international: true'
Converted all calls to strncpy, in AsciiSrc.c to memcpy, so that the (ascii)
  text widget will work properly with data containing nulls.
Added a experimental 'Xaw Scan Type' XawstAlphaNumeric, that shoud make
  edition of C (or any other language) easier in xedit (i.e. the text widget).
  It can be tested with Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right, by now.
Changed the TextWidget to handle text lines that would result in more than
  32767 pixels. Besides the text widget is not meant to be used in the
  edition of binary files, this change allows it.
Changed Text.c:TextScroll() to be smarter when calculating the offset of
  the line table on scroll up.
Added a nice feature, to show the matching '(', '[' or '{', when a ')',
  ']' or '}' is typped.
Changed TextAction.c:FormParagraph() to generate only one undo/redo step.
  
-- xedit --
Changed the defaults file to enable backups and made the backup suffix
  the character '~'.
Replaced all instances of sprintf by XmuSnprintf.
Changed xedit to set the label when saving a file also, to reflect what
  is being edited correctly.
Corrected a bug in the new action 'file-completion', to replace correctly  
  the home directory, and keep correctly whatever was after the '~'. This
  isn't the correct place to this code (xedit/commands.c), since there are
  several other file name prompt windows in Xaw, but since it is required
  another window to show the possible matches, I'll study a better way to
  implement it.
Added a 'hints' feature to xedit. Instead of a 'dead'
  "Use Control-S and Control-R to Search." label, now it allows the label
  string being changed at user settable intervals.


#2205 10 Nov 1998

-- xaw --
 + Fixed some 16 bit overflows in AsciiSink.c and some cases where it would draw
   past the end of the text window (a no-op), the overflows were not a
   problem, but could left the text window with incorrect data.
 + Moved the undo/redo code to TextSrc.c, and some code/data from
   {Ascii,Multi}Src.c to TextSrc.c. The callback now is called when the
   source is changed, or becames unchanged due to an undo/redo. Also
   changed the Scan procedure to be a bit faster.
 + The asciiTextWidget will now accept a source or sink object being set at
   creation time.
 + Fixed the 'struct XawDisplayList' being redefined when compiling Xaw under
   SunOS.
 + Several changes to the SimpleMenuWidget to make the geometry management
   work correctly when adding/removing/changing menu entries at run-time.
 + Added a 'kill-ring' feature to the TextWidget. The behaviour is identical
   to Emacs. Pressing C-K repeteadely will merge the lines being killed, so
   that a C-Y latter will paste all the killed lines.
 + Added the enough glue code (and as backwards compatible as possible) to
   allow the *src object be shared between several TextWidgets. My initial idea
   was to make the TextWidget be able to have more than one source, but, to
   be backwards compatible, I did the reverse (the source can have more than
   one TextWidget).
 + Fixed a automatic wrap bug (TextWidget) that could eat non white space
   characters (my previous patch to this problem was completely wrong).

-- xedit --
 + Added a split-window feature to xedit. To keep xedit simple, it only allows
   two windows at the same time: or subdivides in the vertical or horizontal.
 + Added more some key-bindings, that should do the same as Emacs.

#2291 5 Dec 1998

-- Xaw (only changes to the 'text' code) --
 + Changed the default 'piece size' from BUFSIZ to the value returned by
   the getpagesize() function (or keep BUFSIZ if that value is smaller).
 + Added a case sensitive option to the search popup. This is a 'hack' by
   now, but should not cause trouble to anybody.
 + Fixed a bug inserted when changing the code for the search, the only side
   effect I saw was that the jumping cursor to show the matching '(', '[' or '{'
   stopped working in my last patch.
 + Moved back my change to the function XawTextSetSource. The 'correct' function
   is _XawTextSetSource. This is only to make sure old code should compile
   cleanly.
 + Added line and column number calculation code (and a callback to tell when
   that information changed) to the TextWidget. This was not an easy task,
   because I tried to optimize as much as possible the code, and do relative
   calculations, instead of scanning the entire file to count the number of
   lines (there are several special cases, when removing/inserting text).
 + Added the selection type XawselectAlphaNumeric. This adds one step in
   the sequence word-line-all when doing multiclick in the text.
 + Fixed some bugs in the 'kill ring' feature added in the last patch. Now
   it is expected to never fail.
 + Corrected the indentation of TextP.h, and changed more some fields. The
   internal data of the TextWidget changed a lot, so it is not expected that
   program code read directly the private data, at the price of requiring the
   correct library version.
 + Fixed a small bug in the undo code, that would 'think' the file was unchanged
   in the incorrect position in the undo buffer.
 + Changed the default key bindings for delete/kill word functions to use the
   alpha numeric versions (this is better for coding, and more compatible with
   other text editors).

-- xedit --
 + Changed the labelWindow, to show the current line number (but it is also
   possible to show the current column number, offset or file size).
 + Fixed bug when saving the *scratch* buffer with a new name.
 + The 'changedBitmap' is now correctly displayed on all the windows showing a
   changed file.
 + Small changes to the xedit man page.



#2371 8 Jan 1999

--- Xaw ---
 + More some changes to AsciiSrc.c:Scan(). This improves a bit the speed when
   scanning text.
 + Added sanity checking for AsciiSrc.c:Search(), to avoid the risk of
   deferecing a null pointer (or reading memory out of the text piece) if the
   searched text happens to be larger than a "piece size".
 + Fixed bug when trying to optimize line number calculation, due to a typo,
   while meaning XawTextWrapNever I wrote XawTextWrapLine.
 + Fixed a problem shown by xclipboard, when setting the "string" resource
   of the text source, the sink object was keeping the insertPosition in the
   old text contents, and then, when showing the cursor, it was incorrectly
   'erasing' the old cursor position.
 + Fixed problem in XawTextReplace, that would not update correctly all the
   TextWidget's sharing the same source.
 + Added a kill ring list to the text code. This works like the emacs feature,
   but, unlike emacs, it is not required to press C-Y before M-Y, to start
   looping through the kill ring list. To use it, just press M-Y repeteadly,
   and all the text that was killed will be inserted, one at a time, so that
   you can choose one. Note that the text inserted from the kill ring list
   will also enter in the undo list.
 + Changed the Move{Backward,Forward}Paragraph actions to make the cursor always
   stop in a blank line. This makes only one step moving from a paragragh to
   another, instead of two.
 + Added code to check for overflows in the C-U<number> sequence.
 + Changed the FormParagraph action to keep the cursor at the correct position.
 + Changed the default translations in TextTr.c to get a more emacs like
   behaviour with the kill ring list.

--- xedit ---
 + Added a few more resource settings to the Xedit-sample file.
 + Added some sanity checkings when trying to save a file. This avoids the
   case of saving a file with the name of a directory (but moving the directoy
   to other name before). A possible case is: have a directory named 'dir',
   saves a file as 'dir', but before saving, renames the directory as 'dir~'.
 + Allows saving a file that xedit thinks is not changed (the file may have
   changed on the disk, but the user really wants to rewrite it).
 + Corrected several bugs in the FileCompletion action, and added a new
   feature, that is to complete the partial names, when there is a '/' or '.'
   after the cursor position.


#2479 19 Feb 1999

-- Xaw --
 + Fixed bug in the line numbering code, when removing lines before the
   top position.
 + Changed code to form regions to always show the cursor after formatting the
   text.

-- xedit --
 + Added code to keep the file mode, after saving. This is useful when editting
   scripts, so that the executable flag will not be lost after edition.


#2544 12 Mar 1999
  
-- Xaw --
  Mostly changes to add support to latin-* languages in the text code, when not
  using the international resource.
Actions.c:
 + Corrected some bugs in the boolean expression parser. The old version would
   not parse correclty parenthized expressions, and was giving equal precedence
   to AND, OR and XOR (what is incorrect).
AsciiSink.c:
 + Changed to display characters in the range 0x32-0x7e and 0xa0-0xff literally.
   The other characters are represented as control-codes, as before. This is
   better for edition of Latin-* text files.
AsciiText.c:
 + Changed the code, so that even if the *international resource is not set,
   _XawImRegister and _XawImUnregister are called for the text widget. This is
   useful for latin-* locales, that use one byte wide characters, and makes Xaw
   more compatable with modern toolkits, like qt and gtk.
List.c:
 + Added code to work correctly with a background pixmap.
 + Added a smarter code for list window size calculation, that is used if the
   number of columns is especified to be zero (automatic).
MultiSink.c:
 + Fixed a core-dump problem caused when passing a null pointer to
   XwcTextEscapement.
Text.c:
 + Removed the resource adjustScrollbars. This resource was not used, and its
   funcionality was not finished, and by now, it is not required.
TextAction.c:
 + Does not call XLookpupString in InsertChar any more, but the new function
   _XawLookupString (in XawIm.c) to work correclty with composed characters.
XawIm.c:
 + Added the private function _XawLookupString, that just calls XmbLookupString,
   or in case of any initialization error, XLookupString.

-- xedit --
  The most important change is the addition of a new functionality, that allows
  the user to navigate the file system, in a 'ls -a' like list widget, if
  the file is not a directory it is loaded for edition, else, the list widget
  is rebuilt with the contents of the selected directory. To test it, just
  type:  C-X d, or tab when 'finding a file'. To exit the dirwindow without
  loading a file, type C-G or Escape.
Xedit-sample:
 + Added more some resource entries, to use the new 'emacs dired like' feature.
Xedit.ad:
 + Same as for Xedit-sample, but more important resource settings.
commands.c:
 + The code now checks if the filename is a directory and calls the dirwindow
   code in that case, when trying to open a file.
 + Changed the function IsDir from static to global, to use it from xedit.c.
 + Most of the code for the filesystem navigation window was added to this file.
util.c:
 + Fixed a bug that was causing core dump due to passing garbage to XtGetValues
   as the widget address.
 + Added the code for managing the dirwindow and its relationship with the
   text windows to this file.
xedit.c:
 + Added the code for creation the dirwindow to this file.


#2638 2 Apr 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Added xpm pixmaps support to the library. This time, it is required to
   compile Xaw with -DUSE_XPM.
 + If the xpm image has a mask, the widget will be automatically reshaped
   to the pixmap mask.
 + Changed the kill_ring code in TextAction.c to always end in a text block
   of zero length, this way, it is easier to know when one traversed the
   entire kill ring (it may be interesting to forget the undo sequences
   while traversing the kill ring list).

-- xedit --
 + Changed the Xedit.ad file to avoid overriding a translation that would
   make the search window do not respond to WM_DELETE_WINODW messages.
 + Fixed a core dump condition in the new code for listing files and
   directories, due to deferencing a null pointer.


#2662 10 Apr 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Corrected the problems gererated in my last patch. I was compiling with
   -DUSE_XPM defined, and did'nt realize that the patch would not compile
   without it. Just ifdef'ed again the code to avoid warnings or dead code.

-- xedit --
 + Added a ispell interface to xedit. Sorry for not documenting enough about it 
   the man page, but here is a small explanation of the new funcionality:
    Replace:	Replace's the selected word.
    All (right side of Replace button): Replaces all occurrences of the selected
				        word.
    Undo:	When this button is sensitive, allow undoing the last replace,
		this is useful when doing a incorrect "Replace All" action.
    Ignore:	Ignore this word, and continues spell checking.
    All (right side of Ignore button): Ignore any further ocurrences of the
				       selected word.
    Add:	Add's the selected word to the user's private dictionary.
    Suspend:	Go back to text edition, but does not kill the ispell process,
		This is useful if you have a really big dictionary or slow
		machine. I believe it is mostly useful to keep in memory
		the words selected to be ignored, but that you don't want to
		add to your private dictionary.
    Close:	Kill the ispell process, and go back to text edition.
		Automatically saves the user's private dictionary.
   When pressing the Add button, the word in the "Mispelled word:" field is
   added to the user private dictionary (normally ~/.ispell_*). When pressing
   the Replace button, the text in the "Replace with:" field is used.
   If no word is selected in the "Suggestions:" field, this mean that the
   selected word was not found in the ispell dictionary.


#2716 24 Apr 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Minor changes to AsciiSrc.c to try to get more speed in the FindPiece
   function. Xedit may become very slow when editing files bigger than 1M,
   and I'm studing ways to get more speed in the Scan and FindPiece functions.
   The FindPosition function in *Sink.c also can consume a lot of cpu time,
   and may need some rework.
 + Added submenus support to the SimpleMenuWidget. This is something essencial
   to a widget toolkit. Just plugged in the code of a menu widget I wrote some
   time ago. Xedit uses submenus now. To use it, set the resource menuName
   of a SmeBSBObject to the name of the submenu.
 + Added code for text justification to the TextWidget. To use the justification,
   set the resources autoFill, leftColumn and rightColumn. If autoFill is set,
   and leftColumn is smaller than rightColumn, an alternate code will be
   used in the form-paragrpah action, normally triggered with M-Q. The values
   for justification can be left, right, center and full.
 + Added a overwrite mode to the TextWidget. The default translation is to
   press the Insert key, that will toggle the overwrite mode.
 + Made the TextWidget understand negative values for the multiply. This is
   like the emacs feature, to indent text to the left. To set a negative value
   to the multiply, just start the numeric sequence with a '-'. Like  C-U -1.
 + The code for justification added several new functions to TextAction.c.
   Functions to tabify, untabify, get block boundaries, verify if a line
   is completely blank, and strip excess of spaces.
 + Added a indent action to the TextWidget. The default translation, only
   used by xedit, is C-X Tab, did this way, to make it fully compatable with
   emacs, but other translations can be used. The multiply value is used to
   calculate the amount of spaces to move to the left or right.
 + Corrected a very hard to find (and reproduce) bug in the undo code, that
   would easily cause core dumps. The problem would happen when starting
   editing exactly in the moment the redo automatically reverts to undo.
 + Added translations for toggling the overwriting mode with the Insert key,
   and to paste the selection with S-Insert.

-- xedit --
 + Corrected all the known bugs in the ispell code (including a memory leak).
   And added a compile time limit of 16 levels of undo, for all the actions,
   that include Add, Ignore and Replace. 16 levels is more than enough, but
   more than this can be done with the undo action, but then, only to revert
   replaced text, to remove added words that the undo code forgot, it is
   required to edit the personal dictionary file. The code now also understands
   root/affix combinations, that ispell normally returns when using the
   -m option. The ispell code should now also work when using the international
   resource of the edit window.
 + Added a new file, called options.c, that holds the code for the editMenu,
   to enabling setting the wrap, autoFill, justify, leftColumn, rightColumn,
   verticalScroll and horizontalScroll resources of the current edit window.


#2746 1 May 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Reverted most of the #if NeedWidePrototypes definitions, only two
   functions were kept, to not break some of the new features, but these
   functions aren't called by any program: XawTextSinkDisplayText and
   XawTextSinkClearToBackground.
 + Rewrite of the functions *Sink.c:FindPosition() and FindDistance() to
   try to get more speed.
 + Reworked the function Text.c:_BuildLineTable, to correct some strange
   code, and to avoid unecessary recalculations.
 + Made negative values of the multiply work for all the actions, not only
   for negative indentations. This makes the TextWidget behaviour more
   compatable with emacs.
 + Optimization of the new code for text justification, to avoid a call to
   malloc on every char typped, when undo is enabled.
 + Reorganized the offsets of the fields of the TextWidget, trying to make
   xxgdb work again with the new Xaw code, but, unfortunately, the SimpleWidget
   (a subclass of the TextWidget) have growed by 4 bytes (a XawDisplayList*)
   added at the end of the structure, and xxgdb incorrectly reads the text.sink
   field. Old xxgdb binaries dont work with the current code.
 + Removed several XtIsSubclass checks in TextSrc.c. While those checks could
   be useful for debugging, the functions are called so frequently that it is
   a big waste of time for running programs.

-- xedit --
 + Added/Changed some translations to work correctly when CapsLock and/or NumLock
   are pressed.
 + Fixed some bugs in the ispell code. The biggest bug was that it was not
   correctly saving the Add'ed words in the user dictionary when pressing the
   Close button.


#2764 8 May 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Create two new private functions, to replace internally the public interfaces.
   These two functions are XawTextSinkClearToBackground and
   XawTextSinkDisplayText. These two functions use wide prototypes, and
   are required to support text lines that are represented by more than
   32767 pixels. This was done to make sure that the public interfaces remain
   100% backwards compatible.
 + Fixed the deferencing of a null pointer when the source object of a text
   widget is not initialized. I noticed this problem when recompiling xcolorsel.
 + Added a new type converter to Converters.c, that is Short -> String.
 + Added a new compile time option, called NO_BIN_COMPAT_HACK. If defined,
   it will break some programs that access private data. It only works with
   programs that access private data structures, but don't subclassify any
   widget. It fixed old binaries of chimera1, the Offix editor and xxgdb.
   There is no way to fix old binaries of chimera2, xcolorsel and xmh, these
   programs need to be recompiled. I would like to know of other programs that
   became broken, to try to fix them with the NO_BIN_COMPAT_HACK option.
 + Fixed some compile warnings, with shadowed, uninitialized and unused
   variables.
 + Fixed a inifite loop problem that could happen when the text widget window
   was resized to a very small width.
 + Reverted some of the text widget translations, to avoid conflicts when
   setting the input focus and programs that do so.

-- xedit --
 + Fixed a problem in the file-completion code, that would insert the partial
   match in the incorrect position, if the cursor was not at the end of the
   string.
 + Changed ispell.c to use only one hash for ignored and added words. Also
   changed the IspellSend function to not call itself recursively, what is
   a big problem when spell checking big files that are correct or have too
   few errors.

-- editres --
 + Changed Editres.ad in several places, to try to avoid resource setting
   problems. Most of them were changed to address more directly the resource,
   and avoid confusion. Also, added some new resource settings to configure
   the code I added to widgets.c.
 + Changed widgets.c to make sure the resource setting dialog is allways
   entirely in the screen, and if it does not fit, scrollbars will be created.


#2793 15 May 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Changed AsciiSrc.c:LoadPieces to load the file incrementally, instead of
   allocating a big buffer.
 + Added several new functions to DisplayList.c. Almost all gc and painting
   related functions were mapped to displayList functions. There are
   several optimizations that can yet be done to the displayList code, and
   I'm working on it. That code is clearly not finished yet, but is stable.
   Also, changed some functions to be more exigent with it's parameters,
   because it is better to receive a warning message than see the program
   core dumping. The functions are documented in Xaw.man.
 + Corrected a problem in the SimpleMenu code, to make the sub menus popup
   more 'visually' correct, when popping up in the left side.
 + Added a optimization in Text.c, to avoid unnecessarily recalculating
   the line and column number when scrolling text. A big speed up should
   be seen when scrolling large files.
 + Modified all code that expected TAB_SIZE to be equal to 8, to read the
   TextSink resources, and work properly with whatever value the program
   had set to the tab stops.
 + Fixed a very bad bug in the form-paragraph function. It was very hard
   to find because I was looking at the wrong places. If the text was
   allready formatted, or did not need formatting, the code was not
   reenabling undo, making the undo/redo behaviour imprevisible.

-- xedit --
 + Added Xedit-color.ad file, to show some of the new features of Xaw.
   Tried to keep it simple, but since it uses gradients, maybe it should
   better be called Xedit-TrueColor. The better way to see the functionality
   of this file is (if you don't have it already) add to your .Xdefaults:
#ifdef COLOR
*customization:	-color
#endif
   and make sure xrdb parses it.
 + Changed a bit Xedit.ad, to work properly when Caps Lock is pressed.
 + Several changes to ispell.c. It should run very faster now, because
   the code keeps information about words already ignored or correct
   in the xedit side, instead of asking ispell every time. Added also
   a terseMode resource, and made the interface ask for user interaction
   allways ispell does not say the word is completely correct; the
   terseMode resource makes ispell itself decide what words are correct
   or not.

-- editres --
 + Small patch to Edit-col.ad, to use a default text cursor color of 'Azure'
   in text fields, instead of the default 'black'.


#2811 22 May 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Removed the 'NO_NUMERIC_HACK' preprocessor definition, and renamed the
   'doing_numeric_hack' field of the text widget to 'numeric'.
 + Changed the code to always create the horizontal scrollbar, if requested.
 + Small changes to TextPop.c, to automatically scroll horizontally the
   text window when the text found in a search/replace action is not visible.
 + Added a optimization when editting large files, to rebuild the line table
   if the region containing the text being added/replaced overlaps the lt.top
   field of the text widget.
 + Changed the undo code to also merge text typed when overwrite mode is
   active. The new behaviour is not like emacs (that generates a undo step
   for every character), but uses less memory, making only one undo/redo step.

-- xedit --
 + Added a new file, hook.c that is intended to be used for the addition of
   some new features to xedit, like auto indentation of program files. The
   first feature added is the 'autoReplace' resource, described in the xedit
   man page.
 + Corrected a bug in ispell.c, that would make the code alocate lots of
   memory unnecessarily, due to an uninitialized variable. Thanks to David
   Dawes that found the bug. The bug was not in 3.9Pn, but the solution in
   the later release was not completely correct.


#2834 29 May 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Added a ChangeSensitive function to Command.c, to avoid it creating an
   incorrect insensitive border if the button is set. This is a side effect of
   the function XawCommandToggle I added some time ago. The solution for the
   problem is not very elegant, since it copies almost verbatim the code from
   Simple.c, but it works as expected.
 + Moved some calls to _XawTextSetLineAndColumnNumber in Text.c to other places,
   to make sure it is safe to change the text when the positionCallback is
   called (like what is done by the new xedit file hook.c).
 + Another optimization was added to the undo/redo code. Now it also merge
   erases, needing yet less memory for undo, and this way, generating less
   undo/redo steps.
 + Removed the default translation to call the toggle-overwrite action from
   TextTr.c. Only the xedit edit windows calls this translation now, instead of
   every text widget.

-- xedit --
 + Changed the auto replace feature to be a bit more easier to use. The new
   behaviour is almost identical, but if the user types some text, and it is
   auto replaced, only one undo step is enough to correct it. Example:
   1) user types 'nto.'
   2) text is auto replaced by 'not.'
   3) user call undo action
   4) text is converted to 'nto.'
   It should be a very infrequent problem, but makes the xedit behaviour
   identical to a "well known text editor", from where this feature was borrowed.
 + Added a 'Check' button to the ispell interface. This button allows
   checking the word in the text field. This feature was borrowed from the spell
   checking interface of the Netscape html editor.
 + The ispell checking interface now also asks for user interaction if there are
   two identical words togheter.
 + Added a status bar to the ispell interface, to give feedback to the user
   about what is happening.
 + Added some new resources, to let easier customization of the ispell status
   bar strings. The new resources are documented in xedit.man.

#2849 5 Jun 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Add a OLDXAW define, to enable building a binary compatible version with
   6.1, and changes to the Imakefile, to try to keep the changes only in Xaw.
   I hope it can be removed in the future.
 + Add a XawVendor define, with the value "XFree86". If this is not a good
   idea, please correct it an let me know.
 + Add a XawVersion define. The value for the new xaw is 7000L, and for the
   compatible one is 6700L (same comments as for the XawVendor define).
 + Bug fixes to the undo/redo code, and code to merge erases generated by
   ^H and ^D. Also, if the cursor is moved, it stops merging the text typped
   in the undo buffer.
 + Bug fixes to the Form widget geometry management code, to work correctly
   when child widgets are removed or added at run time.
 + Xaw now links with XPM by default, and the config files where changed to
   enable newly compiled programs to do so.
 + Added 16 pad bytes to every widget, to try to avoid binary compatability
   problems in the future.
 + Added a displayList resource to the Tree Widget.
 + Added the functions XawTextGetSink and XawTextLastPosition, to enable a
   public way to get the <TextWidget>->text.sink and <TextWidget>->text.lastPos,
   since these are the most commonly private fields the programs access in
   the text widget.
 + Added the actions 'capitalize-word', 'donwcase-word' and 'upcase-word' to
   TextAction.c. The bindings are the same as of Emacs (and the way it works).
 + Corrected some problems with negative values of the <TextWidget>->text.mult.

-- xedit --
 + Correct possible problem in the file hook.c, when interpreting the auto
   replace list, that is, it was not checking the buffer size when finding
   the '\' character.
 + Updates for the configuration files.
 + Added a 'Look' button the the ispell interface, that will by default run
   "/usr/bin/bin/egrep -i '^<VALUE OF TEXT FIELD>.*$' /usr/share/dict/words"
   and put up to 256 returned words in the ispell list. The behavior is
   almost identical to the one in the terminal interface of ispell.
 + The ispell interface works correctly with aspell now.
 + Added some resources and a popup to enable changing the dictionaries in
   run time.
 + Added a toggle button to the ispell interface to allow changing the terse
   mode in run-time.
 + Added a 'Uncap' button, to allow adding an uncapitalized word to the
   private dictionary, and enough code to do the capitalization checks inside
   of xedit (to enable undo actions).
 + Added a "text mode" and a "html mode". The html mode is not yet completely
   finished. It must work correctly with some html specific things like
   converting internally "&aacute;" to "á" and so on. I'm planning also, at
   least a nroff mode too.
 + The wordChars resource is set by dictionary now.
   To set the word chars for the br dictionary, write something like:
   *ispell*options.dictionaries.br.wordChars: <VALUE>
  or
   *ispell*br.wordChars: <VALUE>
  or simply
   *ispell*wordChars: <VALUE>
 + The skipLines resource is set only for the text mode now.
   To set it, write something like:
   *ispell*options.formats.text.skipLines: <VALUE>
  or
   *ispell*options*text.skipLines: <VALUE>
  or simply
   *ispell*skipLines: <VALUE>


#2877 12 Jun 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Note: The compatible old version of Xaw is not fully compatible. There
   a few things that are not equal to the standard old Xaw. These are:
	+ The cursor code in the *Sink.c files is not identical, and the
	  field insertCursorOn (type Pixmap) was replaced by the field
	  cursor_position (type XawTextPosition).
	+ There are some changes in TextP.h, that include changes to the fields:
	  options		->	left_margin
	  unrealize_callbacks	->	pad1
	  updateFrom		->	update
	  updateTo		->	pad2
	  numranges		->	pad3
	  maxranges		->	from_left
	  copy_area_offsets	->	pad4
	+ The text window does not increase its size when text is typed past
	  the end of the window, instead of it, it is automatically scrolled
	  horizontally, but this may not be enough to every usage of this
	  feature; xmh uses that code to make the text widget auto resize
	  warning popup widgets. I dont know what is better in this case,
	  if re-enabling the auto resize code of changing xmh to use label
	  widgets in the warning popups.
   It is very unlikely that exists code that will have problems with these
   changes in the fields of the TextWidget and the *SinkObject, but if any
   code that has trouble with it exists, I will promptly make the required
   changes to correct it (at least for the compatible version of Xaw).
 + Several optimizations for the code to redisplay the text window in the
   TextWidget. Including fixes for bugs in the XawTextScroll function, and
   making it really works. Previous versions of the library have made this
   function ineffective, because it was always redrawing everything when
   the text window was scrolled. The optimizations should be more noticeable
   when running some application that uses the TextWidget (like xedit) on
   slow hardware, or over slow connections.
 + Corrections for the FormWidget geometry management code, to work correctly
   in the old version of Xaw, and some bug fixes for the new Xaw. Also added
   8 pad bytes to the FormConstraintsPart structure, to have space for extra
   information on possible future optimizations for the FormWidget geometry
   management code.
 + Some fixes for the OLDXAW define in the SimpleMenuWidget code, that was
   not hiding some of the new fields introduced in the new Xaw code.
 + Some corrections for the code handling the necessity of having scrollbars
   in the text widget, and bug fixes for cases where the scrollbars were not
   being updated when the text window contents were changed.
 + Re-enabled code to also process GraphicsExpose events in the text code. It
   became required due to the optimizations in the text redisplay code.
 + Several fixes in TextAction.c, for symbols that were not being included
   in the compatible version of the library, and for symbols that were being
   included with no need.
 + Fixes for the form-paragraph action, in the old Xaw code.

-- xedit --
 + Some bug fixes for the ispell undo code, to avoid deferencing a NULL pointer
   in the function IspellCheckUndo.
 + Added code to handle correctly &<VALUE>; in ispell.c, when using the html
   mode.
 + Fixed some compile time warnings, and updated the code for setting the
   scrollbars in options.c.


#2899 19 Jun 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Changed all the 'char pad[<number>]' to 'XtPointer pad[<number>/4]' to
   make sure 64 bit machines will not have binary compatibility problems before
   the 32 bit ones.
 + Added a new static function 'WritePiecesToFile' to AsciiSrc.c, to avoid
   allocation of temporary memory. This is useful when editing very large
   files (I have some people using xedit on text files that can have up to
   80,000 lines).
 + Added more some optimizations to AsciiSrc.c:Scan, to try to get the maximum
   speed of this function.
 + Added a new function to the displayList's, called 'image', that will tile
   pixmaps on the widget. It is documented in Xaw.man.
 + Several widget classes did not have a 'extension' field. I added it to them.
   The first usage of this field that I'm planning is to extend the *Src and
   *Sink objects to handle formatted text, and add text properties, like
   foreground, background, font and so on.
 + Fixed a bug in MultiSrc.c, that was crashing Xaw after the first character
   was typed, or if text was removed.
 + Some minor changes to SimpleMenu.c, to work properly with very large menus.
 + Fixed some bugs that were caused by my previous optimizations of the text
   redisplay code.
 + Bug fixes and optimizations to TextPop.c, there were some cases that the
   function XawTextDisableRediplay was being called, but XawTextEnableRedisplay
   was not being called later because of a error condition (the error
   conditions were only warnings).
+  Updates to Xaw.man.

-- xedit --
 + Fixed a memory leak when freeing list widget strings. The code was not
   releasing the memory of the string at offset 0, in the list.
 + Changed the way the ispell undo code handles the terse mode, to not need
   to make the toggle button insensitive.
 + Updated xedit.man.


#2932 26 Jun 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Added a new tip resource to the SimpleWidget. This may also be seen as
   a test of the binary compatibility issues. Besides of being a new feature,
   it cannot cause problems with old binaries, because the code is only
   called if the tip resource is set to any SimpleWidget subclass. If the
   tip resource is set or reset, the SimpleWidget code will call one of the
   two new functions XawTipEnable or XawTipDisable.
 + Added 3 new files: Tip.c, Tip.h and TipP.h. These files are used only
   by the new Xaw.
 + Updates to Xaw.man, including a problem with accented characters on SunOS.

-- xedit --
 + Added resource configurations to show the new tip code in Xaw.
 + Some fixes to ispell.c, to make it more previsible/user-friendly.
 + Fixes xedit.man to avoid problems with accented characters.


#2964 3 Jul 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Fix for problem found in the search/replace dialog when using splitted
   windows in xedit.
 + Added initialization for the display_list field of the Tree widget.

-- xedit --
 + Fixed some problems in the undo code of ispell interface.


#2999 10 Jul 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Added code to check the return value of XAllocColor and XAllocNamedColor in
   Pixmap.c.
 + Reverted back some code, and did a carefull review of the code in TextPop.c
   to avoid the possibility of calling XawTextDisableRedisplay, and not calling
   XawTextEnableRedisplay later (due to errors or end of file reached).
 + Added code to TextSrc.c, to use two static variables, that represent a new
   line in 8 bits and wchar_t, to avoid allocating memory in the undo buffers
   to store only a new line.
 + Small change in the behavior of the Tip widget, to not unmap the tip window
   when the cursor is moved.

-- Xmu --
 + Fixed a bug and a typo in the XmuToupper macro.

-- xedit --
 + Small update to the Xedit-sample file.
 + Fixed a bug in the ispell code that checks for repeated words.


#3122 14 Aug 1999
-- Xaw --
 + Mixed fonts and colors can be used in the text widget (currently only
   in the Ascii*Object).
 + Added the XawTextAnchor, XawTextEntity, XawTextProperty, XawTextPropertyList,
   XawTextPaintStruct, XawTextPaintList and XawTextPropertyInfo structures to
   Xaw, to be used in the new text code.
 + Added the functions XawTextSourceAddAnchor, XawTextSourceNextAnchor,
   XawTextSourcePrevAnchor, XawTextSourceRemoveAnchor and
   XawTextSinkConvertPropertyList, that probably should not be used outside of
   Xaw.
 + Added the functions XawTextSourceFindAnchor, XawTextSourceAnchorAndEntity,
   XawTextSourceAddEntity, XawTextSourceClearEntities and XawTextSinkGetProperty
   that are probably the ones that should be most used in programs.
 + Italic fonts should be always displayed correctly.
 + The text widget cursor is now displayed with a gc with the Xor function, to
   avoid unnecessary computation/redrawing.
 + Most changes were done in the {Ascii,Text}{Src,Sink}Object, but the text
   widget was also a bit modified for things like automatically changing the
   number of lines in the line table when needed.

-- Xmu --
 + Fixed bug in Clip.c, that could cause a SEGV.

-- xedit --
 + Added the file c-mode.c, to interface with the new Xaw text code, and show
   what can be done when interfacing that new code.
 + Added the necessary code to util.c and options.c to let the user select
   if he or she wants to use the color/font syntax highlight in the C/C++ mode.


# 26 Aug 1999

--Xaw--
 + Added initial support for two new XawTextEntity attributes, that enable
   hidden text and replaced text. This initial support was the minimum
   required to get the new html mode in xedit working. A lot of code does
   math with text positions, and became broken with the addition of these
   two attributes. Since only code that knows about these two attributes
   should use it, it is only a question to fix the remaining code in
   Xaw/xedit.
 + Bug fixes to AsciiSink.c:PreparePaint to work correctly with tabs and
   the two new entity attributes.
 + Disabled the translation "c<Key>q,<Key>Tab" of the search/replace popup.
   This action is already done by the translation "<Ctrl>Q,<Key>" that I added
   to TextTr.c. Disabling that translation has the advantage that now it
   is possible to replace ^Ms by nothing.
 + Added some new functions to TextSink.c. The functions XawTextSinkCopyProperty,
   XawTextSinkAddProperty and XawTextSinkCombineProperty are candidates to being
   public in the future, but, there is a problem when using
   XawTextSinkCombineProperty, that requires the AsciiSinkObject having the
   correct XawTextPropertyList, what can generate a "chicken and egg" like
   problem (I did some hacks in xedit to have the first html-mode version
   working).
 + Added several new flags to the XawTextProperty attributes, and a new field,
   called xlfd_mask.
 + Some bug fixes to XawTextSourceReplace and to the code to manage the
   XawTextAnchor e XawTextEntity structures. The form-paragraph, called with
   M-Q does several consecutive text changes, and was very useful to find bugs.
 + The flag XAW_TENTF_REPLACE is a hack for XawTextSourceAddEntity currently.
   The function XawTextSourceAddEntity will probably change its parameters
   to receive a structure pointer, or a pointer parameter.

--xedit--
 + Fixed some bugs in c-mode.c. Again, this patch fixes all the bugs I have
   found.
 + Added the html-mode.c file to xedit. The html-mode is in its initial steps.
   It is not usable yet, but should not core-dump or leak memory (unless you
   try to edit the file, then, I cannot say what will happen). The html mode
   should be used only to see a rendered version of the file, but, there are
   several markups not implemented. To be usable, it must yet understand at
   least <ul>, <ol>, <li>, <dl>, <dd>, <hr> and the table tags.
