	These changes have been made to Xaw since X11R4.



Documentation:
	Fixed definition of XtAppInitialize().

	Changed all references to XawOrient* and XtOrient* to Xtorient*.

	Many other corrections and clarifications.

Everywhere:
	Function prototypes for public interfaces.

	Many bugs not mentioned here have been fixed.

AllWidgets:
	Add WidgetNode table for use with listres and viewres.

AsciiSrc (Text):
	No warning message is printed when the file can not be
	written to, the return value should be enough info.

	GetValues on the string resource was failing when
	"useStringInPlace" was set to true.

	Memory leak when freeing pieces in a source of type "ascii String"
	has been plugged.

	Buffer is now updated whenever the "string" resource is	set using 
	XtSetValues().  If type is file then the file is read in again.

Box:
	The public header file now includes Xmu/Converters.h for the 
	orientation resources.

Clock:
	Made subclass of simple instead of Core

Command:
	Fixed bug in changing shape style to Rectangular.

Dialog:
	Resource Type of Icon changed from Pixmap -> Bitmap.

Form:
	The geometry handler now will now disallow geometry management
	reqests that will force the child outside the Form's window.

	Fixed missing parens typo in PreferredGeometry.

	Fixed EdgeTypes to be Xaw* instead of Xt*, but left the
 	old definitions around with #define so that code will still work.

	StringToWidget converter no longer caches resources.  

Logo:
	Made subclass of simple instead of Core.
	Fixed reverse video.

Mailbox:
	Made subclass of simple instead of Core.
	Fixed reverse video and many other bugs.

MenuButton:
*	The MenuButton widget no longer places a server grab on itself.
	Instead, PopupMenu is registered as a grab action.  As a result
	of this, clients which popped up menus without using XtMenuPopup
	or MenuPopup or PopupMenu in the menu button translations will 
	fail to have a grab active.  They should make a call to 
	XtRegisterGrabAction on the appropriate action in the application 
	initialization routine, or use a different translation.

Paned:
	The public header file now includes Xmu/Converters.h for the 
	orientation resources.

Panner:	This widget is new in R5.

Porthole:
	New for R5.

Scrollbar:
	Fixed bug that could call XtReleaseGC() with garbage
	Made subclass of simple instead of Core

	Type of thumb resource is XtRBitmap; it used to be XtRPixmap.
	However, if applications provide the resource conversion, the 
	Scrollbar's SetValues can still handle pixmaps of correct depth.

Simple:
	Added a color cursor converter. and the new resource types:
		XtNpointerColor
		XtNpointerColorBackground
		XtNcursorName	

SmeBSB:
	Right bitmaps are now painted in the correct location.

	Right and Left Bitmaps can be specified in resource files, and
	at startup time.

Text:
	If there is no current selection the the selection extends
	from the insert point, rather than some random location.

	Forward (Backward) Paragraph works at the paragraph boundaries now.

	Selecting a word now transitions correctly at BOTH end points.

	Infinite loop when using fill paragraph in a read only text widget
	has been found and fixed.

	When the "resize" resource is set the text will start up with
	exactly enough space to contain the text in the widget.

	Fixed a bug that could cause an infinite loop when Meta-Q was used
	to invoke the form-paragraph function on a read-only text widget.

	Exposures fixed.

TextP.h:
	Symbolic constants private to the Text widget should not conflict
	with operating system headers files.  The names of these symbolic
	constants have each had the prefix Xaw added to them:
		#define XawLF	0x0a
		#define XawCR	0x0d
		#define XawTAB	0x09
		#define XawBS	0x08
		#define XawSP	0x20
		#define XawDEL	0x7f
		#define XawBSLASH '\\'

	
Toggle:
*	Toggle widget state is preserved across changes in sensitivity.

	A string to widget converter is regisetered for radio groups.

Tree:
	New for R5.

Paned:
	Fixed bug that caused XtGeometryYes returns to have bogus values,
	causes panes to get random sizes.
